            "Data assembling primarily refers to gathering diverse data forms, especially unstructured text data, and converting it into structured formats ready for analysis. This process includes steps such as data collection, cleaning, integration, transformation, and storage. Proper data assembling is critical because quality input data directly impacts the accuracy and usability of analytic outcomes.\n",
            "Techniques and Methods in Data Assembling for Text Analytics\n",
            "1. Text Preprocessing\n",
            "Text preprocessing is essential to handle raw text which is often noisy. It includes:\n",
            "   * Tokenization: Splitting text into words or phrases\n",
            "   * Stop word removal: Eliminating common but uninformative words (e.g., \"the\", \"and\")\n",
            "   * Stemming and Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root forms\n",
            "   * Removing punctuation, numbers, and irrelevant characters\n",
            "These steps normalize data to reduce inconsistencies and enhance analysis quality.\n",
            "      2. Information Extraction\n",
            "This technique extracts entities, attributes, relationships, and key facts from unstructured text. Extracted information is stored in databases for further querying and retrieval. It is widely used for mining relevant pieces of knowledge from large text datasets.\n",
            "      3. Clustering\n",
            "Unlabeled text data is grouped into clusters based on internal similarities, an unsupervised learning technique. Clustering helps in identifying intrinsic groupings or patterns that are not initially obvious.\n",
            "      4. Text Summarization\n",
            "Automated summarization condenses long texts into shorter forms, preserving key information. It helps users quickly grasp the essence of large document collections.\n",
            "      5. Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n",
            "NER identifies and classifies proper nouns like names of people, organizations, locations, and events within text. It supports indexing and retrieval tasks.\n",
            "      6. Sentiment Analysis\n",
            "This technique gauges the subjective tone or sentiment behind textual content, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. It is useful in customer feedback and social media analysis.\n",
            "      7. Topic Modeling\n",

            "In today's data-driven business environment, organizations deal with vast amounts of data from multiple sources. Without proper governance, data inconsistencies, security risks, and compliance violations can occur. Data governance improves:\n",
            "* Data quality and reliability\n",
            "* Regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)\n",
            "* Data security and privacy\n",
            "* Clear ownership and accountability for data assets\n",
            "* Operational efficiency by enabling streamlined data management processes\n",
            "* Strategic decision-making through trusted data availability\n",
            "Core Components of Data Governance Framework\n",
            "A robust data governance framework typically includes the following pillars:\n",
            "1. Data Governance Policies and Standards\n",
            "These define how data is to be managed, accessed, shared, and protected. It includes policies on data privacy, security, retention, and quality.\n",
            "2. Roles and Responsibilities\n",
            "Effective governance requires clear assignment of roles such as Data Owners, Data Stewards, and Data Custodians responsible for data accuracy, compliance, and accessibility.\n",
            "3. Data Quality Management\n",
            "Processes and tools that monitor and improve data accuracy, completeness, timeliness, and consistency.\n",
            "4. Data Catalog and Metadata Management\n",
            "A centralized system stores descriptions and context for data assets, making them easier to find and understand.\n",
            "5. Compliance and Risk Management\n",
            "Ensures adherence to legal and regulatory requirements and assesses risks related to data breaches or misuse.\n",
            "6. Data Lifecycle Management\n",
            "Managing data from creation and storage through archival and deletion to optimize storage and comply with retention policies.\n",
            "Data Governance Models\n",
            "Organizations adopt various governance models depending on size, culture, and data maturity:\n",
            "   * Centralized Model: A central team responsible for governance decisions.\n",
            "   * Decentralized (Federal) Model: Business units have autonomy but follow company-wide standards.\n",
            "   * Hybrid Model: Combines centralized policy-making with business unit implementation.\n",
            "Challenges in Data Governance\n",
            "   * Resistance to change within organizations and lack of clear data ownership.\n",
            "   * Complexity in integrating and managing data from disparate systems.\n",
            "   * Balancing data accessibility with security and privacy.\n",
            "   * Keeping governance policies updated with evolving regulatory requirements.\n",
            "   * Ensuring sufficient resources and executive sponsorship.\n",

            "Chinese officials are investigating outdoor clothing brand Arc'teryx after it apologised for a fireworks display in the Himalayan region of Tibet, which drew backlash for its potential impact on the fragile ecosystem.Videos from the 19 September event show multi-coloured fireworks erupting across foothills in a display designed by Chinese artist Cai Guo Qiang as part of a promotional campaign.But the show sparked a barrage of criticism online, with people saying the stunt contradicts Arc'teryx's image as a conservation-focused brand and calling for a boycott of its clothing line.The Canadian firm apologised for the display, saying it was \"out of line with Arc'teryx's values\".\n",
            "The firm said that it will work with an external agency to assess the project's impact, adding that it had used entirely biodegradable materials. Arc'teryx also said that the spectacle was aimed at raising awareness of mountain culture.Founded in 1989, Arc'teryx is hugely popular for its high-end sportswear and mountaineering gear and runs more than 150 shops globally. It is owned by Hong Kong-listed fitness equipment company Anta Sports.It partnered with pyrotechnics artist Cai to stage the high-altitude day-time display called Rising Dragon, set at over 5,000 meters in Tibet's Shigatse region, a gateway to Himalayan peaks like Everest.The mountains are also sacred to people in Tibet, where many follow Buddhism. It  has been a tightly-controlled part of China since it was annexed in the 1950s, leading some online to ask how and why the project was approved in the first place.Critics said the mountains were too fragile for fireworks, and the explosions, colour and smoke would have disrupted the ecosystem and local wildlife.\n",
            "A top comment on Arc'teryx'sapology postsaid the display was \"not something that can be forgiven with a single apology post\", and urged the company to take responsibility for any long-term environmental impact.Another commenter questioned how a project of such scale could have been approved by so many people.\"The public's criticism has alerted us that the evaluation of the expression of art needs to be more professional and we need to be more humble and respectful of nature,\" Arc'teryx said in its statement.Mr Cai, the artist who has also been criticised, has apologised for his role and said he would work with authorities to help in the area's recovery.The 67-year-old artist made his name with gunpowder paintings and outdoor pyrotechnic displays. He famously oversaw fireworks for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n"

            "0   ﻿Overview of Data Assembling\\nData assembling primarily refers to gathering diverse data forms, especially unstructured text data, and converting it into structured formats ready for analysis. This process includes steps such as data collection, cleaning, integration, transformation, and storage. Proper data assembling is critical because quality input data directly impacts the accuracy and usability of analytic outcomes.\\nTechniques and Methods in Data Assembling for Text Analytics\\n1. Text Preprocessing\\nText preprocessing is essential to handle raw text which is often noisy. It includes:\\n   * Tokenization: Splitting text into words or phrases\\n   * Stop word removal: Eliminating common but uninformative words (e.g., \"the\", \"and\")\\n   * Stemming and Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root forms\\n   * Removing punctuation, numbers, and irrelevant characters\\nThese steps normalize data to reduce inconsistencies and enhance analysis quality.\\n      2. Information Extraction\\nThis technique extracts entities, attributes, relationships, and key facts from unstructured text. Extracted information is stored in databases for further querying and retrieval. It is widely used for mining relevant pieces of knowledge from large text datasets.\\n      3. Clustering\\nUnlabeled text data is grouped into clusters based on internal similarities, an unsupervised learning technique. Clustering helps in identifying intrinsic groupings or patterns that are not initially obvious.\\n      4. Text Summarization\\nAutomated summarization condenses long texts into shorter forms, preserving key information. It helps users quickly grasp the essence of large document collections.\\n      5. Named Entity Recognition (NER)\\nNER identifies and classifies proper nouns like names of people, organizations, locations, and events within text. It supports indexing and retrieval tasks.\\n      6. Sentiment Analysis\\nThis technique gauges the subjective tone or sentiment behind textual content, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. It is useful in customer feedback and social media analysis.\\n      7. Topic Modeling\\nTopic modeling algorithms detect recurring themes or topics in documents. They edge towards understanding the high-level semantic structure of large text corpora.\\nBest Practices in Data Assembling for Text Analysis\\n         * Always start with a clear research objective to choose suitable assembly and analytic methods.\\n         * Emphasize high data quality, conducting rigorous cleaning and validation.\\n         * Combine qualitative manual insights with quantitative automated approaches.\\n         * Use a mix of multiple methods (e.g., sentiment analysis with clustering) to gain comprehensive understanding.\\n         * Leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to interpret human language efficiently.\\nTools and Technologies\\nPopular tools include:\\n         * Libraries like NLTK, SpaCy, and Gensim for text preprocessing and modeling.\\n         * Machine learning frameworks such as Scikit-learn and TensorFlow for clustering and classification.\\n         * APIs for named entity recognition and sentiment detection.\\n         * Data management platforms that support scalable storage and real-time processing.\\nChallenges and Considerations\\n         * Handling unstructured and noisy data demands significant preprocessing efforts.\\n         * Integrating heterogeneous data from multiple sources can complicate assembly.\\n         * Balancing between preserving contextual meaning versus reducing dimensionality is critical.\\n         * Ethical considerations and privacy protection must be ensured during data collection and processing.   \n",

Without proper governance, data inconsistencies, security risks, and compliance violations can occur. Data governance improves:\\n* Data quality and reliability\\n* Regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)\\n* Data security and privacy\\n* Clear ownership and accountability for data assets\\n* Operational efficiency by enabling streamlined data management processes\\n* Strategic decision-making through trusted data availability\\nCore Components of Data Governance Framework\\nA robust data governance framework typically includes the following pillars:\\n1. Data Governance Policies and Standards\\nThese define how data is to be managed, accessed, shared, and protected. It includes policies on data privacy, security, retention, and quality.\\n2. Roles and Responsibilities\\nEffective governance requires clear assignment of roles such as Data Owners, Data Stewards, and Data Custodians responsible for data accuracy, compliance, and accessibility.\\n3. Data Quality Management\\nProcesses and tools that monitor and improve data accuracy, completeness, timeliness, and consistency.\\n4.

Cooper was speaking to the BBC before attending a conference on Monday at the UN in New York where France and other European states are due to make a similar announcement. In what was a significant change in policy, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced the UK's recognition of a Palestinian state on Sunday, along with Canada, Australia and Portugal. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the moves, saying they give \"a huge reward to terrorism\". Asked by the BBC if she was concerned Israel would take this declaration as a pretext for annexing parts of the West Bank, Cooper said she had made it clear to her Israeli counterpart that he and his government must not do that. She said: \"We have been clear that this decision that we are taking is about the best way to respect the security for Israel as well as the security for Palestinians. \"It's about protecting peace and justice and crucially security for the Middle East and we will continue to work with everyone across the region in order to be able to do that.\" Cooper said extremists on both sides were seeking to abandon any prospect of a two-state solution, which the UK had a moral obligation to revive. \"The easy thing to do would be to just walk away and to say well it is all just too hard,\" Cooper said. \"We just think that is wrong when we've seen such devastation, such suffering. \"Just as we recognise Israel, the state of Israel ... so we must also recognise the rights for the Palestinians to a state of their own as well.\" She did not say when the UK's Consulate General in East Jerusalem would become a full embassy, saying it would continue while a diplomatic process began with the Palestinian Authority. The foreign secretary was speaking in New York, where the UN General Assembly is convening this week. Cooper will push to build international consensus on a framework for peace in the Middle East, the Foreign Office has said. France will co-chair a meeting alongside Saudi Arabia addressing the path to a two-state solution to the conflict, after itpledged to recognise Palestinian statehood in July. Belgium is also expected to follow France's declaration at the meeting. Making the announcement on Sunday, Sir Keir said he wanted to \"revive the hope of peace and a two-state solution\". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by saying that Palestinian statehood \"will not happen\". Speaking to BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said that \"the Jewish community will never forgive Labour for this betrayal\" and accused the prime minister of an \"abandonment\". The US described the move as a diplomatic gift to Hamas after it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Sir Keir stressed this was not the case as the terms of the recognition mean Hamas can have \"no future, no role in government, no role in security\". This message was echoed in a statement from the Foreign Office, which said the foreign secretary would use the UN meeting to \"ensure violent terrorists like Hamas have no role to play in the future of a Palestinian state\". The prime minister added that the decision was instead a \"pledge to the Palestinian and Israeli people that there can be a better future\", saying the \"starvation and devastation [in Gaza] are utterly intolerable\". Sir Keir, who has repeatedly said Hamas can have no role in the future governance of a Palestinian state, said during his announcement that the UK had already proscribed and sanctioned Hamas and that he had directed work to sanction further Hamas figures in the coming weeks. The UK's minister for the Middle East Hamish Falconer said that \"the time is right now because a two-state solution is under peril like never before.\" \"The threat to two states living in peace, side-by-side has got worse and worse, he told BBC Breakfast. Falconer stressed that \"Hamas would not be the victors\" and that \"any Palestinian state would be demilitarised.\" Hamas on Sunday welcomed the recognition as an \"important step in affirming the right of our Palestinian people to their land and holy sites\" but said it must be accompanied by \"practical measures\" that would lead to an \"immediate end\" to the war. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, the Conservatives' deputy chair Matt Vickers said that the prime minister was \"rewarding Hamas\". \"Hamas has already said this is a victory for them and the evil things they did on October 7\", he said. \"This is not the way you play the game, this not what you do if you want to get a two state solution.\" Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, told Breakfast that the move was \"an essential path\" towards a two-state solution but that \"this is only a first step\". \"We need to put pressure on the Netanyahu government to stop the killing, to bring food in for the people of Gaza, and also to get the hostages out.\" Last week, a UN commission of inquiry said thatIsrael had committed genocide in Gaza. Across a three-page resolution, the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) presented a litany of actions undertaken by Israel throughout the 22-month-long war that it recognises as constituting genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Around 65,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza in the nearly two-year war. UN-backed health experts have also declared a famine in Gaza City. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the genocide report was based on \"Hamas lies\" and poor research, calling it an \"embarrassment to the legal profession\". Netanyahu has repeatedly denied starvation is taking place in Gaza and has said that where there is hunger, it is the fault of aid agencies and Hamas. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the UK's decision, saying it would help pave the way for the \"state of Palestine to live side by side with the state of Israel in security, peace and good neighbourliness\". Palestine is currently recognised as a state by around 75% of the UN's 193 member states, but has no internationally agreed boundaries, capital or army - making recognition largely symbolic. The two-state solution refers to the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, broadly along the lines that existed prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Due to Israel's military occupation in the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority, set up in the wake of peace agreements in the 1990s, is not in full control of its land or people. In Gaza, where Israel is also the occupying power, Hamas has been the sole ruler since 2007. UK ministers have highlighted the continued expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law, as a key factor in the decision to recognise Palestinian statehood. Mohammed Jarrar, mayor of the West Bank city of Jenin, told the BBC that \"this Israeli government wants to annex the West Bank\" - but stressed that recognition was important as \"it confirms the fact that the Palestinian people possess a state, even if it is under occupation\". Netanyahu repeated his intentions on Sunday, saying \"we doubled Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] and we will continue on this path\". Far-right Israeli minister Itamar Ben Gvir responded to the news by calling for Israel to annex the West Bank and dismantle the Palestinian Authority. Canada, Australia and Portugal also announced the move on Sunday, with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu accusing leaders of giving a \"huge reward to terrorism\".

With the president approaching 90 years of age and another possible candidate in jail, finding the right leadership would be a challenge The UK, Australia and Canada have recognised a Palestinian state, while France and other countries are set to do so in the coming days.

Trump was the headline speaker at the packed event on Sunday, which saw top officials from his administration, including Vice-President JD Vance, praise Kirk's political legacy after he was shot dead on 10 September. \"He was assassinated because he lived bravely, he lived boldly and he argued brilliantly,\" Trump told the crowd at the State Farm Stadium near Phoenix. Kirk's wife, Erika, also delivered a tearful speech in which she said she had forgiven her husband's alleged killer. \"My husband, Charlie, he wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life,\" she said, adding: \"I forgive him because it is what Christ did. The answer to hate is not hate.\" Tens of thousands of people queued for hours outside the stadium before the event, with some even camping out the night before to secure their spot. Many wore Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats, other Trump-branded items and red, white and blue outfits. Inside the stadium, the mood and atmosphere resembled a raucous political rally or megachurch service with music beforehand from Christian bands who prompted singalongs and prayer from the crowd of almost 100,000. The list of speakers included members of Kirk's organisation, Turning Point USA, which focuses on conservative activism on college campuses, well-known figures in the conservative movement, Trump administration officials and those who said they had been shaped by Kirk's work and right-wing Christian worldview. They stressed the need to continue the 31-year-old's activism and emphasised his deep faith throughout the five-hour service. Kirk, who was debating students at a university in Utah when he was shot dead, was repeatedly described as a martyr and cast as a historic figure for the conservative movement. Several speakers said they believed his death would further revitalise the conservative moment in America, which is already in a powerful position given Trump's hold of the White House and the Republican control of Congress. \"The day that Charlie died, angels wept, but those tears have been turned into fire in our hearts,\" said Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff. \"Our enemies cannot comprehend our strength.\" At one stage, Elon Musk, who had a bitter and public falling out with Trump earlier this year, sat next to the president and the pair shook hands and chatted. He later posted a picture of them together with the caption: For Charlie. Within the stands and on stage at the State Farm Stadium, Kirk was revered as an activist for free speech and a mobiliser of the youth vote for Trump. \"Charlie didn't just help, he made the winning difference, I promise you that,\" White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said. \"We wouldn't be here without him,\" Vice-President JD Vance told the crowd, who at times erupted into an extended chant of \"U-S-A, U-S-A\". \"We've got it from here,\" he added, while discussing Kirk's political legacy. Vance was one of several key figures from the Trump administration who spoke on stage, with others including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Heath Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. They were followed by Kirk's wife, Erika, who was tearful at times as she described her relationship and vowed to continue her husband's work. She was named the new CEO of Turning Point USA after his death. \"I saw the wound that ended his life,\" she said. \"I felt everything he would expect to feel. I felt shock. I felt horror, and a level of heartache that I didn't even know existed. \"These past 10 days after Charlie's assassination, we didn't see violence. We didn't see rioting. We didn't see revolution. Instead, we saw what my husband always prayed he would see in this country, we saw revival,\" Kirk told the crowd. She then said she had forgiven her husband's alleged killer, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. \"That man, that young man, I forgive him. I forgive him because it was what Christ did and it is what Charlie would do,\" Kirk said. There was a raucous reception when President Trump took the stage after Erika Kirk. He repeatedly praised Charlie Kirk, while at times turning to his usual political talking points including crime in American cities and mocking his predecessor Joe Biden. \"He's a martyr now for America's freedom,\" Trump said of Kirk. \"I know I speak for everyone here today when I say that none of us will ever forget Charlie. And neither now will history.\" The president then said he disagreed with Kirk on one thing. \"He did not hate his opponents, he wanted the best for them,\" he said, prompting some laughs. \"That's where I disagree with Charlie. I hate my opponents and I don't want what's best for them.\" Trump also attacked what he called the \"radical left\" and blamed the left for violence in the country. At the end of his address, in which he described Kirk as a \"great of his generation\", Trump was joined on stage by Erika Kirk and the pair hugged as the crowd applauded. The deeply partisan event was reflective of how Kirk's death has laid bare the extreme political divisions in America, with many on the right casting blame on the left for stoking political violence. The Trump administration is seeking a crackdown on what it calls the \"radical left\", which in turn has prompted accusations of government overreach and claims Kirk's death is being used as a pretext to intrude on civil liberties. Robinson, whohas been charged with Kirk's murder, is facing the death penalty but a motive for the killing is yet to be revealed by officials. Kirk was 18 when he co-founded Turning Point USA, a student organisation focused on spreading conservative ideas on college campuses. He would hold debates on campuses and became known for his combative style, inviting students to step up to the microphone and challenge his right-wing Christian worldview in front of a baying audience. Clips of these exchanges built him a huge following - more than 5m followers on X and 7m on TikTok - that helped him mobilise the youth vote for President Trump. While he energised young conservatives, his remarks on issues such as race and crime also routinely prompted an angry liberal backlash. He was a strong supporter of gun rights, vehemently opposed abortion, was critical of transgender rights and promoted false claims about Covid-19. The five-hour service saw top officials from the Trump administration pay tribute to the conservative activist. The president expresses frustration that \"nothing is being done\" and calls on Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate his opponents. Oracle chairman Larry Ellison and Dell founder Michael Dell are also both involved, the president tells Fox News. Journalists have been told Pentagon passes will be contingent on agreeing to new restrictions. Law enforcement officials will also be required to identify themselves while conducting duties by both name and badge number. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

  Chinese officials are investigating outdoor clothing brand Arc'teryx after it apologised for a fireworks display in the Himalayan region of Tibet, which drew backlash for its potential impact on the fragile ecosystem. Videos from the 19 September event show multi-coloured fireworks erupting across foothills in a display designed by Chinese artist Cai Guo Qiang as part of a promotional campaign. But the show sparked a barrage of criticism online, with people saying the stunt contradicts Arc'teryx's image as a conservation-focused brand and calling for a boycott of its clothing line. The Canadian firm apologised for the display, saying it was \"out of line with Arc'teryx's values\". The firm said that it will work with an external agency to assess the project's impact, adding that it had used entirely biodegradable materials. Arc'teryx also said that the spectacle was aimed at raising awareness of mountain culture. Founded in 1989, Arc'teryx is hugely popular for its high-end sportswear and mountaineering gear and runs more than 150 shops globally. It is owned by Hong Kong-listed fitness equipment company Anta Sports. It partnered with pyrotechnics artist Cai to stage the high-altitude day-time display called Rising Dragon, set at over 5,000 meters in Tibet's Shigatse region, a gateway to Himalayan peaks like Everest. The mountains are also sacred to people in Tibet, where many follow Buddhism. It  has been a tightly-controlled part of China since it was annexed in the 1950s, leading some online to ask how and why the project was approved in the first place. Critics said the mountains were too fragile for fireworks, and the explosions, colour and smoke would have disrupted the ecosystem and local wildlife. A top comment on Arc'teryx'sapology postsaid the display was \"not something that can be forgiven with a single apology post\", and urged the company to take responsibility for any long-term environmental impact. Another commenter questioned how a project of such scale could have been approved by so many people. \"The public's criticism has alerted us that the evaluation of the expression of art needs to be more professional and we need to be more humble and respectful of nature,\" Arc'teryx said in its statement. Mr Cai, the artist who has also been criticised, has apologised for his role and said he would work with authorities to help in the area's recovery. The 67-year-old artist made his name with gunpowder paintings and outdoor pyrotechnic displays. He famously oversaw fireworks for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Their burrowing and grazing help maintain riverbanks and improve biodiversity, conservationists say. Researchers are pioneering ways of removing algae from around plants at Budle Bay in Northumberland. An assembly report calls for the introduction of 10 new river bathing areas by 2034. People are urged to correctly dispose of food waste as councils consider monthly general collections. Bake them, freeze them, fire them from a gun or blast them into space: tardigrades can survive almost anything. Some experts think they might even survive right up until the Sun dies.

                                                                                                       Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are expected to be part of a group of investors trying to buy TikTok in the US, President Donald Trump says. In a Fox News interview that aired on Sunday, Trump said the men would \"probably\" be involved in a proposed deal to keep TikTok operating in the US. He also said Oracle chairman Larry Ellison and Dell founder Michael Dell would likely be involved. \"I think they're going to do a really good job,\" Trump said, describing the men as \"American patriots\". The president, who called his Chinese counterpart earlier this week, said the US and China were making progress on a deal that would see the social media platform's American operations sold to US investors. The sale is required because of a law passed by Congress in April 2024 that would ban the app unless its Chinese parent company ByteDance sells its US arm. That law was proposed over fears that Beijing could access the personal data of TikTok's 170m American users. Its enforcement is on hold pending a deal. When asked about who was involved in the proposed TikTok deal, Trump told Fox's The Sunday Briefing that \"they're very well-known people\" who would raise a \"tremendous amount\" of money. \"Larry Ellison is one of them. He's involved. This great guy, Michael Dell is involved. I hate to tell you this, but a man named Lachlan is involved. Do you know who Lachlan is?\" he said. \"And Rupert is probably going to be in the group.\" Lachlan Murdoch recently took over Fox Corp and News Corp, the family's media empire, bringing a lengthy succession battle with his siblings to a close. Rupert Murdoch, 94, is chairman emeritus of News Corp. After Trump's comments on Sunday, US media reports suggested the Murdoch's would not be investing in a personal capacity but instead through Fox Corp. Their media empire includes the Wall Street Journal and Fox News, and they are known for their conservative views and right-leaning media outlets. But they have also occasionally drawn the ire of Trump, who is currently suing the Wall Street Journal for defamation over a report alleging he signedJeffrey Epstein's birthday book. The White House has raised expectations that a deal is on the verge of completion amid political pressure to take the social media app's US operations out of the hands of its Chinese owners ByteDance. On Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said a deal could be signed \"in the coming days\". Leavitt, who was also speaking to Fox, said data and privacy for the app in the US would be led by Oracle and \"the algorithm will also be controlled by America as well\". The proposed TikTok deal raises the prospect of the Murdochs and the Ellisons, now two of the country's most powerful families in US media, gaining significant influence over one of America's most popular social media apps. China has not confirmed whether a deal has been agreed. China's official state news agency Xinhua's account of Trump's conversation with Xi reported the Chinese premier as as saying that Beijing \"welcomes negotiations\". On Saturday, China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement: \"China's position on TikTok is clear: The Chinese government respects the wishes of the enterprise, and welcomes it to carry out commercial negotiations in accordance with market rules to reach a solution compliant with China's laws and regulations, and strikes a balance of interests.\" ByteDance has not yet commented on Trump's latest remarks. India may adapt, but the US risks losing skilled workers who have helped build the Silicon Valley and hospitals. Kirk's widow, Erika, also delivers a tearful speech, saying she forgives her husband's alleged killer. The BBC spoke to Americans who travelled to Arizona to attend the late conservative activist's memorial service. The five-hour service saw top officials from the Trump administration pay tribute to the conservative activist.

Lee Jae Myung told the BBC North Korea was producing an additional 15-20 nuclear weapons a year and that a freeze - as \"an interim emergency measure\" - would be \"a feasible, realistic alternative\" to denuclearisation for now. North Korea declared itself a nuclear power in 2022 and vowed to never relinquish its weapons. \"So long as we do not give up on the long-term goal of denuclearisation, I believe there are clear benefits to having North Korea stop its nuclear and missile development,\" Lee Jae Myung said. \"The question is whether we persist with fruitless attempts towards the ultimate goal [of denuclearisation] or we set more realistic goals and achieve some of them,\"  Lee added. President Lee, who entered office in June, wants to establish peaceful relations with North Korea and reduce tensions, which flared under his predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached for trying to impose martial law last year. The South Korean leader has been vocal aboutwanting President Trump to resume nuclear talks with Kim, which broke down in 2019 during Trump's first term, after the US asked the North to dismantle its nuclear facilities. In a speech to parliament on Sunday, the North Korean leader suggested he would be willing to negotiate with Trump – but only if the US dropped its demand for the North to denuclearise. Lee told the BBC that he thought it possible that Trump and Kim could come back together, given they \"seem to have a degree of mutual trust\". This could benefit South Korea and contribute to global peace and security, he added. The BBC sat down with the South Korean president at his office in Seoul, ahead of his trip to the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Monday. South Korea currently holds the presidency of the UN Security Council, but Lee would not be drawn on whether the body was failing South Korea, because for years both China and Russia have blocked attempts to impose further sanction the North over its nuclear programme. \"While it's clear the UN is falling short when it comes to creating a truly peaceful world, I still believe it is performing many important functions,\" Lee said, adding that reforming the Security Council was \"not very realistic\". Asked whether China was now enabling North Korea's nuclear weapons programme, Lee said it was \"impossible to know\", but based on his current knowledge this was not his understanding. Earlier this month Chinese President Xi Jinping welcomed Kim at a military parade in Beijing alongside Russia's Vladimir Putin and, unlike in past meetings, China did not publicly mention theNorth's nuclear weapons or denuclearisation. The burgeoning ties between Beijing, Moscow and Pyongyang, on show at China's parade, put South Korea in \"a very difficult situation\", Lee said. \"Seeing China, Russia and North Korea become so close is clearly not desirable for us,\" he said, adding that he would likely respond by continuing to work closely with the US and Japan. Historically, South Korea has balanced its relationships between the US - its military ally - and China - which it relies on for much of its trade - but this tightrope is becoming trickier to walk. Recently Lee said he would stand with the US in the new world order that is emerging, but speaking to him, it is clear he wants to avoid making enemies in the process. This once left-leaning, hardline opposition leader now presents himself as a centrist. He chooses his words and positions carefully, as he tries to deftly navigate South Korea's place in a shifting world. \"The world is dividing into two camps, and South Korea is positioned right on the border,\"  he said, noting his country's \"truly precarious location\" next to China and Russia. \"This situation is become increasingly difficult. But these camps cannot completely shut their doors, so we can position ourselves somewhere in the middle.\" Lee was even careful not to discard a future relationship with Russia, which has forged a military partnership with North Korea during the Ukraine war - sending it food, oil and vast sums of money in return for weapons and troops. \"It is clear that Russia's invasion of Ukraine should be condemned, and that the war must end as soon as possible,\" he said. \"But relations between countries are not straightforward, and we find ways to co-operate wherever possible and strive to co-exist peacefully.\" His caution is understandable. The perils of relying too heavily on the US have never been more apparent, with both America's friends and foes caught up in Trump's ongoing trade war. Lee successfully managed toreduce tariffs on South Korea down to 15%, and during a recent trip to the White House he appeared to charm the president. But since then, trade talks have stalled, with the two sides unable to agree on the terms of a deal. Then, a fortnight ago,US immigration officials detained hundreds of Korean workerswho were building a car battery factory in Georgia – part of South Korea's commitment to move manufacturing to the US, while also investing hundreds of billions of dollars there. Lee's government managed to secure the workers' release a week later. \"As president, I feel a profound sense of responsibility for the harsh treatment our citizens endured,\" he said, describing the incident as \"shocking\". Korean companies would now likely be \"more hesitant to invest in the US\", he added. But Lee said he believed he could use the incident to strengthen Seoul's relationship with Washington. \"There's a Korean proverb that says, 'after the rain, the ground hardens'.\" At home, Lee is presiding over a polarised country, shaken by months of political turmoil, after its previous president tried to orchestrate a military takeover. Yoon, who is now facing life in prison, stoked tensions with North Korea. He tried to justify his failed attempt at martial law by claiming the country's institutions had been infiltrated by supporters of Pyongyang. Now, Lee says he is trying to do what he can to repair trust with the North. After entering office, he stopped the government in Seoul fromtransmitting radio broadcasts into North Korea. These broadcasts were known to anger Kim Jong Un, but were one of the few ways that North Korean people, who are increasingly isolated, could receive information from outside the country. The move was criticised by human rights organisations. \"We judge that [these broadcasts] have almost no practical effect,\" Lee said when asked to justify his decision. He argued that any benefits were not enough to outweigh the cost of antagonising the regime. \"What matters is restoring trust between the North and South, especially since the last government's stance toward North Korea was so hostile. We think these measures will help get North Korea to return to talks.\" The North has so far rejected Lee's goodwill gestures, calling him \"delusional\" and a \"daydreamer\". But Lee is not naïve. He knows Donald Trump is his most likely path to peace on the peninsula, and that this path must be redrawn. Eager to portray himself as a pragmatist, he understands, unlike others before him, that North Korea's nuclear weapons cannot be negotiated out of existence – at least not for the time being. Ragasa is forecast to hit northern Philippines on its way to southern China later this week. The 17-year-old's murder sparked debate about women on social media in Pakistan. Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old who unsuccessfully applied for asylum, was arrested by immigration authorities last week. Norma, a movie based on a viral true story from TikTok, has become a nationwide obsession. For 24 years, Shankar endured a lonely existence - including at least 13 spent in solitary confinement.

Trump was the headline speaker at the packed event on Sunday, which saw top officials from his administration, including Vice-President JD Vance, praise Kirk's political legacy after he was shot dead on 10 September. \"He was assassinated because he lived bravely, he lived boldly and he argued brilliantly,\" Trump told the crowd at the State Farm Stadium near Phoenix. Kirk's wife, Erika, also delivered a tearful speech in which she said she had forgiven her husband's alleged killer. \"My husband, Charlie, he wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life,\" she said, adding: \"I forgive him because it is what Christ did. The answer to hate is not hate.\" Tens of thousands of people queued for hours outside the stadium before the event, with some even camping out the night before to secure their spot. Many wore Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats, other Trump-branded items and red, white and blue outfits. Inside the stadium, the mood and atmosphere resembled a raucous political rally or megachurch service with music beforehand from Christian bands who prompted singalongs and prayer from the crowd of almost 100,000. The list of speakers included members of Kirk's organisation, Turning Point USA, which focuses on conservative activism on college campuses, well-known figures in the conservative movement, Trump administration officials and those who said they had been shaped by Kirk's work and right-wing Christian worldview. They stressed the need to continue the 31-year-old's activism and emphasised his deep faith throughout the five-hour service. Kirk, who was debating students at a university in Utah when he was shot dead, was repeatedly described as a martyr and cast as a historic figure for the conservative movement. Several speakers said they believed his death would further revitalise the conservative moment in America, which is already in a powerful position given Trump's hold of the White House and the Republican control of Congress. \"The day that Charlie died, angels wept, but those tears have been turned into fire in our hearts,\" said Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff. \"Our enemies cannot comprehend our strength.\" At one stage, Elon Musk, who had a bitter and public falling out with Trump earlier this year, sat next to the president and the pair shook hands and chatted. He later posted a picture of them together with the caption: For Charlie. Within the stands and on stage at the State Farm Stadium, Kirk was revered as an activist for free speech and a mobiliser of the youth vote for Trump. \"Charlie didn't just help, he made the winning difference, I promise you that,\" White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said. \"We wouldn't be here without him,\" Vice-President JD Vance told the crowd, who at times erupted into an extended chant of \"U-S-A, U-S-A\". \"We've got it from here,\" he added, while discussing Kirk's political legacy. Vance was one of several key figures from the Trump administration who spoke on stage, with others including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Heath Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. They were followed by Kirk's wife, Erika, who was tearful at times as she described her relationship and vowed to continue her husband's work. She was named the new CEO of Turning Point USA after his death. \"I saw the wound that ended his life,\" she said. \"I felt everything he would expect to feel. I felt shock. I felt horror, and a level of heartache that I didn't even know existed. \"These past 10 days after Charlie's assassination, we didn't see violence. We didn't see rioting. We didn't see revolution. Instead, we saw what my husband always prayed he would see in this country, we saw revival,\" Kirk told the crowd. She then said she had forgiven her husband's alleged killer, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. \"That man, that young man, I forgive him. I forgive him because it was what Christ did and it is what Charlie would do,\" Kirk said. There was a raucous reception when President Trump took the stage after Erika Kirk. He repeatedly praised Charlie Kirk, while at times turning to his usual political talking points including crime in American cities and mocking his predecessor Joe Biden. \"He's a martyr now for America's freedom,\" Trump said of Kirk. \"I know I speak for everyone here today when I say that none of us will ever forget Charlie. And neither now will history.\" The president then said he disagreed with Kirk on one thing. \"He did not hate his opponents, he wanted the best for them,\" he said, prompting some laughs. \"That's where I disagree with Charlie. I hate my opponents and I don't want what's best for them.\" Trump also attacked what he called the \"radical left\" and blamed the left for violence in the country. At the end of his address, in which he described Kirk as a \"great of his generation\", Trump was joined on stage by Erika Kirk and the pair hugged as the crowd applauded. The deeply partisan event was reflective of how Kirk's death has laid bare the extreme political divisions in America, with many on the right casting blame on the left for stoking political violence. The Trump administration is seeking a crackdown on what it calls the \"radical left\", which in turn has prompted accusations of government overreach and claims Kirk's death is being used as a pretext to intrude on civil liberties. Robinson, whohas been charged with Kirk's murder, is facing the death penalty but a motive for the killing is yet to be revealed by officials. Kirk was 18 when he co-founded Turning Point USA, a student organisation focused on spreading conservative ideas on college campuses. He would hold debates on campuses and became known for his combative style, inviting students to step up to the microphone and challenge his right-wing Christian worldview in front of a baying audience. Clips of these exchanges built him a huge following - more than 5m followers on X and 7m on TikTok - that helped him mobilise the youth vote for President Trump. While he energised young conservatives, his remarks on issues such as race and crime also routinely prompted an angry liberal backlash. He was a strong supporter of gun rights, vehemently opposed abortion, was critical of transgender rights and promoted false claims about Covid-19. The five-hour service saw top officials from the Trump administration pay tribute to the conservative activist. The president expresses frustration that \"nothing is being done\" and calls on Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate his opponents. Oracle chairman Larry Ellison and Dell founder Michael Dell are also both involved, the president tells Fox News. Journalists have been told Pentagon passes will be contingent on agreeing to new restrictions. Law enforcement officials will also be required to identify themselves while conducting duties by both name and badge number. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

They showed us the graves of the three boys they lost in the past two years – one-year-old Rahmat, seven-month-old Koatan and most recently, three-month-old Faisal Ahmad. All three suffered from malnutrition, say Ghulam and Nazo. \"Can you imagine how painful it's been for me to lose three children? One minute there's a baby in your arms, the next minute they are empty,\" says Nazo. \"I hope every day that angels would somehow put my babies back in our home.\" There are days the couple go without food. They break walnut shells for a living in the Sheidaee settlement just outside the city of Herat in western Afghanistan and receive no help from the Taliban government or from NGOs. \"Watching helplessly as my children cried out of hunger, it felt like my body was erupting in flames. It felt like someone was cutting me into half with a saw from my head to my feet,\" said Ghulam. The deaths of their children are not recorded anywhere, but it's evidence of a silent wave of mortality engulfing Afghanistan's youngest, as the country is pushed into what the UN calls an unprecedented crisis of hunger. \"We started the year with the highest increase in child malnutrition ever recorded in Afghanistan. But things have got worse from there,\" says John Aylieff, the World Food Programme's country director. \"Food assistance kept a lid in this country on hunger and malnutrition, particularly for the bottom five million who really can't cope without international support. That lid has now been lifted. The soaring of the malnutrition is placing the lives of more than three million children in peril.\" Aid has sharply declined because the single largest donor, the US, stopped nearly all aid to Afghanistan earlier this year. But WFP says eight or nine other donors who funded them in the last two years have also stopped this year, and many others are giving much less than they were last year. One reason is donors are responding to a number of crises around the world. But the Taliban government's policies also affect how much the world is willing to help. What are they doing to help their citizens? \"Those who are facing malnutrition, those who are facing hunger, it's because of sanctions, because of aid cuts by international organisations. It's not because of the government,\" the head of the Taliban's political office in Doha, Suhail Shaheen, told the BBC. \"The government has expanded its assistance to the people and is doing what is in its capacity, But our budget is based on internal revenues, and we are facing sanctions.\" But the Taliban's intransigence on women's rights affects its bid for international recognition, and for the sanctions against it to be lifted. Other decisions, like the recent enforcement of a previously announced ban on Afghan women working for NGOs is putting the delivery of \"life-saving humanitarian assistance at serious risk\", the UN says. The malnutrition emergency is compounded by other factors too – a severe drought that has affected agricultural incomes in more than half of Afghanistan's provinces, and the forced return of more than two million Afghans from Iran and Pakistan, reducing the remittances they send back. At the Sheidaee graveyard we found startling evidence of child deaths. There were no records of the people buried there, so we counted the graves ourselves. Roughly two-thirds of the hundreds of graves were of children – it was easy to tell the small graves from the bigger ones. Villagers told us the graveyard is relatively new, between two to three years old. They also confirmed that it was not a specific graveyard for children. As we walked through the settlement in Sheidaee, people came out carrying their children. Rahila was carrying Hibatullah who, at two, cannot stand up. Durkhanee brought out her son Mohammad Yusuf, who's also nearly two and unable to stand. Nearly half of all Afghan children under the age of five are stunted, the UN says. In one of the mud and clay homes, Hanifa Sayedi's one-year-old son Rafiullah could barely hold himself up, even while he's sitting. \"I took him to a clinic where they told me he's malnourished, but I don't have the money to keep taking him there,\" she says. She and her husband have two other children, and dry pieces of bread with Afghan green tea are the only meals the family can afford. Some days they don't eat. Rafiullah doesn't have teeth yet, so Hanifa soaks the bread in the tea and feeds him. \"But it's not enough and he's hungry all the time. To make him sleep, I give him these medicines,\" she says, pulling out two strips of tablets.  One is a strip of Lorazepam, an anti-anxiety medicine, the other is Propanolol, a drug that controls high blood pressure. One strip costs 10 Afghani ($0.15; £0.13) the same amount as one piece of bread. Hanifa says she bought them at a pharmacy, saying she wanted sleeping pills for herself. \"I feel so guilty that my children are going hungry and I can't do much. I feel suffocated and like I should kill my children and myself,\" she says. Doctors say that when given to young children, drugs such as these can damage the child's heart, kidneys and liver, and can even be life-threatening if given for a prolonged period of time. Hanifa's is one of millions of pleas for help. \"It's incredibly heartbreaking to be in this country and watch this unfold. WFP has a hotline. We've had to retrain our call operators because we're getting a much higher proportion of calls from women threatening suicide because they're desperate and they just don't know how to feed their children any more,\" says WFP's John Aylieff. The closure of food assistance to communities like those in Sheidaee and in other parts of Afghanistan has meant that more children are being pushed into severe acute malnutrition. We've seen evidence of this in hospitals across Afghanistan. In the malnutrition ward of the Badakhshan regional hospital in the north-east, there were 26 children in 12 beds. Three-month-old Sana, the youngest baby on the ward, has malnutrition, acute diarrhoea and a cleft lip. She is her mother Zamira's second baby. The first child, another baby girl, died when she was 20 days old.  \"I'm scared this child might also meet the same fate. I'm tired of this life. It's not worth living,\" says Zamira, with a stricken look on her face. As Zamira speaks, Sana's hands and feet turn blue. Her tiny heart is not pumping enough blood. A nurse puts her on oxygen. In another cot is five-month-old Musleha, who has malnutrition and measles. Her mother Karima says she's hardly opened her eyes in the past few days. \"She's in pain and I don't know what to do. We are poor and don't have access to nutritious food. That's why she's in this state,\" says Karima. In the cot next to Musleha, are twins Mutehara and Maziyan. The baby girls also have malnutrition and measles, and are half the weight they should be at 18 months. Mutehara lets out a feeble cry. It's evident she's in pain.  A week after we visited the hospital, we followed up with the families of the babies. We were told that Sana, Musleha and Mutehara had all died.  This isn't the first time we've documented child deaths from malnutrition in Afghanistan, but this is the worst we've ever seen. Within a span of a week, three babies from one ward became the latest casualties of Afghanistan's crisis of hunger. And it's about to get worse. \"WFP's humanitarian funding will run out in November. At the moment, we are starting to turn away malnourished women and children from the health centres because we simply cannot afford to feed them. In November, we will stop unless we get a further injection of funding,\" says John Aylieff. With winter approaching, it is hard to overstate the urgency of the disaster unfolding in Afghanistan.

On Friday, US President Donald Trump stunned the tech world by announcing an up to 50-foldhike in the cost of skilled worker permits- to $100,000. Chaos followed: Silicon Valley firms urged staff not to travel outside the country, overseas workersscrambled for flights, and immigration lawyers worked overtime to decode the order. By Saturday, the White House sought to calm the storm,clarifyingthat the fee applied only to new applicants and was a one-off. Yet, the long-standing H-1B programme - criticised for undercutting American workers but praised for attracting global talent - still faces an uncertain future. Even with the tweak, the policy effectively shutters the H-1B pipeline that, for three decades, powered the American dream for millions of Indians and, more importantly, supplied the lifeblood of talent to US industries. That pipeline reshaped both countries. For India, the H-1B became a vehicle of aspiration: small-town coders turned dollar earners, families vaulted into the middle class, and entire industries - from airlines to real estate - catered to a new class of globe-trotting Indians. For the US, it meant an infusion of talent that filled labs, classrooms, hospitals and start-ups. Today, Indian-origin executives run Google, Microsoft and IBM, and Indian doctors make up nearly 6% of the US physician workforce. Indians dominate the H-1B programme, making up more than 70% of the  recipients in recent years. (China was the second-largest source, making up about 12% of beneficiaries.) In tech, their presence is even starker: a Freedom of Information Act request in 2015 showedover 80% of \"computer\" jobs went to Indian nationals- a share industry insiders say hasn't shifted much. The medical sector underlines the stakes. In 2023, more than8,200 H-1Bs were approved to work in general medicine and surgical hospitals. India is the largest single source of international medical graduates (who are typically in US on H-1B visas) and make upabout 22% of all international doctors. With international doctors forming up to a quarter of US physicians, Indian H-1B holders likely account for around 5-6% of the total. Experts say pay data shows why Trump's new $100,000 fee is unworkable. In 2023, the median salary for new H-1B employees was $94,000, compared with $129,000 for those already in the system. Since the fee targets new hires, most won't even earn enough to cover it, say experts. \"Since the latest White House directive indicates that the fee would only apply to new H-1B recipients, this is more likely to cause medium and long-term labour shortages instead of immediate disruption,\" Gil Guerra, an immigration policy analyst at the Niskanen Center, told the BBC. India may feel the shock first, but the ripple effects could run deeper in the US.  Indian outsourcing giants such as TCS and Infosys have long prepared for this by building local workforces and shifting delivery offshore. The numbers tell the story: Indians still account for 70% of H-1B recipients, but only three of the top 10 H-1B employers had ties to India in 2023, down from six in 2016, according to Pew Research. To be sure, India's $283bn IT sector faces a reckoning with its reliance on shuttling skilled workers to the US, which accounts for over half its revenue. IT industry body Nasscom believes the visa fee hike could \"disrupt business continuity for certain onshore projects\". Clients are likely to push for repricing or delay projects until legal uncertainties are cleared, while companies may rethink staffing models - shifting work offshore, reducing onshore roles and becoming far more selective in sponsorship decisions. Indian firms are also likely to pass on the increased visa costs to US clients, says Aditya Narayan Mishra of CIEL HR, a leading staffing firm. \"With employers reluctant to commit to the heavy cost of sponsorship, we could see greater reliance on remote contracting, offshore delivery and gig workers.\" The broader impact on the US could be severe: hospitals facing doctor shortages, universities struggling to attract STEM students, and start-ups without the lobbying muscle of Google or Amazon are likely to be hit hardest. \"It [visa fee hike] will force US companies to radically change their hiring policies and offshore a significant amount of their work. It will also ban founders and CEOs coming to manage US-based businesses. It will deal a devastating blow to US innovation and competitiveness,\" David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, told BBC. That anxiety is echoed by other experts. \"The demand for new workers in fields like tech and medicine [in US] is projected to increase (albeit in uneven ways), and given how specialised and critical these fields are, a shortage that lasts even a few years could have a serious impact on the US economy and national well-being,\" says Mr Guerra. \"It will likely also incentivise more skilled Indian workers to look at other countries for international study and have a cascading effect on the American university system as well.\" The impact, in fact, will be felt most sharply by Indian students, who make up one in four international students in the US. Sudhanshu Kaushik, founder of the North American Association of Indian Students, which represents 25,000 members across 120 universities, says the timing - just after September enrolments - has left many new arrivals stunned. \"It felt like a direct attack, because the fees are already paid, so there's a big sunk cost of anywhere between $50,000 and $100,000 per student - and the most lucrative route to entering the American workforce has now been obliterated,\" Mr Kaushik told the BBC. He predicts the ruling will hit US university intake next year, as most Indian students opt for countries where they can \"put down permanent roots\". For now, the full impact of the tax hike remains uncertain. Immigration lawyers expect Trump's move to face legal challenges soon. Mr Guerra warns that the fallout could be uneven: \"I expect the new H-1B policy will bring a number of negative consequences for the US, though it will take some time to see what those may be.\" \"For example, given that the executive order allows for certain companies to be excepted, it could be possible that some heavy H-1B users such as Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta will find a way to be exempted from the H-1B fee policy. If they all get exemptions, however, this would largely defeat the purpose of the fee.\" As the dust settles, the H-1B shake-up looks less like a tax on foreign workers and more like a stress test for US companies - and the economy. H-1B visa holders and their families contribute roughly $86bn annually to the US economy, including $24bn in federal payroll taxes and $11bn in state and local taxes. How companies respond will determine whether the US continues to lead in innovation and talent - or cedes ground to more welcoming economies. The former deputy PM says Starmer and Trump's relationship is \"getting a bit embarrassing\". Kirk's widow, Erika, also delivers a tearful speech, saying she forgives her husband's alleged killer. The BBC spoke to Americans who travelled to Arizona to attend the late conservative activist's memorial service. The five-hour service saw top officials from the Trump administration pay tribute to the conservative activist. Lower consumer taxes are expected to ease some of the impact of Trump's 50% tariffs on India. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

  Chinese officials are investigating outdoor clothing brand Arc'teryx after it apologised for a fireworks display in the Himalayan region of Tibet, which drew backlash for its potential impact on the fragile ecosystem. Videos from the 19 September event show multi-coloured fireworks erupting across foothills in a display designed by Chinese artist Cai Guo Qiang as part of a promotional campaign. But the show sparked a barrage of criticism online, with people saying the stunt contradicts Arc'teryx's image as a conservation-focused brand and calling for a boycott of its clothing line. The Canadian firm apologised for the display, saying it was \"out of line with Arc'teryx's values\". The firm said that it will work with an external agency to assess the project's impact, adding that it had used entirely biodegradable materials. Arc'teryx also said that the spectacle was aimed at raising awareness of mountain culture. Founded in 1989, Arc'teryx is hugely popular for its high-end sportswear and mountaineering gear and runs more than 150 shops globally. It is owned by Hong Kong-listed fitness equipment company Anta Sports. It partnered with pyrotechnics artist Cai to stage the high-altitude day-time display called Rising Dragon, set at over 5,000 meters in Tibet's Shigatse region, a gateway to Himalayan peaks like Everest. The mountains are also sacred to people in Tibet, where many follow Buddhism. It  has been a tightly-controlled part of China since it was annexed in the 1950s, leading some online to ask how and why the project was approved in the first place. Critics said the mountains were too fragile for fireworks, and the explosions, colour and smoke would have disrupted the ecosystem and local wildlife. A top comment on Arc'teryx'sapology postsaid the display was \"not something that can be forgiven with a single apology post\", and urged the company to take responsibility for any long-term environmental impact. Another commenter questioned how a project of such scale could have been approved by so many people. \"The public's criticism has alerted us that the evaluation of the expression of art needs to be more professional and we need to be more humble and respectful of nature,\" Arc'teryx said in its statement. Mr Cai, the artist who has also been criticised, has apologised for his role and said he would work with authorities to help in the area's recovery. The 67-year-old artist made his name with gunpowder paintings and outdoor pyrotechnic displays. He famously oversaw fireworks for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Their burrowing and grazing help maintain riverbanks and improve biodiversity, conservationists say. Researchers are pioneering ways of removing algae from around plants at Budle Bay in Northumberland. An assembly report calls for the introduction of 10 new river bathing areas by 2034. People are urged to correctly dispose of food waste as councils consider monthly general collections. Bake them, freeze them, fire them from a gun or blast them into space: tardigrades can survive almost anything. Some experts think they might even survive right up until the Sun dies.

                                  Australian officials have promised telecommunications giant Optus will face \"significant consequences\" over a systems outage linked to multiple deaths. The incident last week left hundreds of people across more than half of the country unable to call emergency services for 13 hours. Optus - one of the country's two major providers - says at least three people died as a result, and its chief executive has apologised to their families and the public for the \"completely unacceptable\" failure. The company is under fire for its delayed handling of the incident - the second such outage for the firm in two years - and the nation's communications regulator is investigating. More than 600 calls to emergency services failed last Thursday, primarily coming from South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. At least two calls to triple-0 made from south-western New South Wales also did not connect. However Optus waited 40 hours to inform the public about the incident, and also did not tell regulators until the issue was resolved - counter to standard practice, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) says. In a press conference on Friday afternoon, Optus boss Stephen Rue blamed the outage on a technical fault identified during a network upgrade. He said welfare checks conducted after services were restored confirmed three people had died, including a baby boy, though police have since said the network failure was \"unlikely\" to be a cause in that case. Authorities in WA also say they believe a fourth person died after their call to triple-0 failed. In a series of updates over the weekend, Mr Rue said the company was unaware of the incident for 13 hours. Multiple customers had tried to advise the company its network wasn't working, but the complaints weren't escalated or handled \"as would be expected\", he said. \"I would like to reiterate how sorry I am about the very sad loss of the lives of four people who could not reach emergency services in their time of need,\" Mr Rue said on Sunday. \"What I can assure you is that actions are and will be taken to ensure this does not happen in future.\" In a statement, an Acma spokesperson said the regulator was \"deeply concerned\" by the situation and its handling. \"Australians must be able to contact emergency services whenever they need help. This is the most fundamental responsibility every telco provider has to the public.\" The regulator has previously found Optus failed to provide access to emergency call services for 2,145 peopleduring an outage in 2023, and then failed to check on 369 people affected afterwards. It was hit with more than A$12m ($8m; £6m) in penalties. Communications Minister Anika Wells on Monday said telecommunications providers had \"no excuse\" for triple-0 call failures and that she had spoken to Mr Rue - who the prime minister says should considering resigning. \"You would be unsurprised to hear that I expressed my unbelievable disappointment that we were here again so quickly. Or here again at all.\" The company had \"perpetuated an enormous failure on the Australian people\" and would face \"significant consequences\", she said. Investigations are still underway, but Mr Rue has said he intends to give public updates daily \"as more information becomes known\". Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Philippines as the nation braces for a super typhoon that has been described by regional authorities as potentially \"catastrophic\". Super typhoon Ragasa, packing 230km/h (143mph) wind gusts, is forecast to make landfall over sparsely populated northern islands on Monday, before barrelling west towards southern China. Ragasa brings a \"high risk of life-threatening storm surge\" with peak heights exceeding 3m (10ft), the Philippine weather bureau said. Schools and government offices in large parts of the country, including the capital Manila, have been shut and authorities have warned of widespread flooding and landslides and damage to homes and infrastructure. The remote Batanes or Babuyan islands, where Ragasa is forecast to make landfall, are home to about 20,000 people, many of whom live in poverty. The islands lie about 740km (460 miles) of Taiwan, where nearly 300 people have been evacuated from Hualien, a county in the east. Ragasa is not expected to hit Taiwan directly but is set to drench the island's east coast with heavy rains. Forest areas and nature trails across southern and eastern Taiwan have been closed since early Monday, while some ferry services have also been suspended. A super typhoon is the equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane. Authorities in China's Guangdong province have advised residents to prepare for \"catastrophic\" and \"large-scale disaster\". Heavy rains and strong winds will be felt as early as Tuesday, two days before the storm is forecast to make landfall. In Hong Kong, authorities said the weather would \"deteriorate rapidly\" on Tuesday, while the education bureau said it is deliberating over school arrangements. Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific said it would cancel 500 flights departing the city from 18:00 local time tomorrow, while Hong Kong Airlines said it would stop all departures from the city. Ragasa, known locally in the Philippines as Nando, comes as the South East Asian nation reels from weeks of widespread flooding caused by an unusually fierce monsoon. Tens of thousands protested across the country on Sunday againstcorruption in governmentthat has been blamed for a severe lack in flood control infrastructure.

Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of the capital Manila, with some clashing with police.

to more aggressively investigate his political adversaries. In a social media post addressed directly to Bondi, he said: \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility.\" Trump expressed frustration that \"nothing is being done\", before calling on Bondi to investigate former FBI director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Senator Adam Schiff, who oversaw his first impeachment trial. Shortly after, he posted again to praise Bondi who he said was \"doing a great job\". \"I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, \"same old story as last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam \"Shifty\" Schiff, Leticia??? They're all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,\" Trump said on Saturday. His statement was roundly criticised by Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer who said \"this is the path to a dictatorship\". \"The justice department has always been a very, very strong civil service, no matter who was in charge, a Democrat or Republican. They went after law violators without fear or favour,\" he told CNN on Sunday. \"He's turning it into an instrument that goes after his enemies, whether they're guilty or not,\" he said of the president. Asked about his comments on Sunday, Trump said: \"They have to act. They have to act fast.\" \"I think Pam Bondi is going to go down as one of the best attorney generals of the ages,\" he said. The president's post came a day afterfederal prosecutor Erik Siebert left his post after Trump said he wanted him to resignfor failing to prosecute New York Attorney General Letitia James over allegations of mortgage fraud. The New York Times reported that Siebert had told senior justice department officials their investigations had not unearthed enough evidence to prosecute James. James, a Democrat who won a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump in 2023, has denied the mortgage fraud allegations as \"baseless\" and motivated by \"revenge\". On Saturday, Trump said Siebert had been fired and did not quit.\"I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so,\" he said. Trump also praised Bondi and said he had nominated a replacement for Siebert. \"She is very careful, very smart, loves our Country, but needs a tough prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, like my recommendation, Lindsey Halligan, to get things moving,\" he said. Since the 1970s, the justice department has sought to position itself as mostly independent from the president. But Trump tested that norm. During his first term, he fired one attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for recusing himself from an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The second, William Barr, resigned after pushing back against Trump's false claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. During his election campaign, Trump promised to seek revenge against many of his perceived political enemies - including former President Joe Biden - and others who have opposed him. He has revoked the security clearances - which allows people to access classified material - of several officials, including James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought the criminal hush-money case, He has fired several prosecutors who worked for special counsel Jack Smith on two criminal probes against him. He has also taken actions against law firms with attorneys who were involved in investigations into allegations against him, including the firm that employed former special counsel Robert Mueller. The BBC spoke to Americans who travelled to Arizona to attend the late conservative activist's memorial service. The five-hour service saw top officials from the Trump administration pay tribute to the conservative activist. Oracle chairman Larry Ellison and Dell founder Michael Dell are also both involved, the president tells Fox News. Journalists have been told Pentagon passes will be contingent on agreeing to new restrictions. Law enforcement officials will also be required to identify themselves while conducting duties by both name and badge number. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

                                                                                                                                      For years, local DJ Dave Gilmore soundtracked other people's nights out in pubs and clubs. But now he's curating a uniquely personal playlist - the songs of his own life to carry him through terminal illness. The list includes both November Rain and Sweet Child O' Mine by Guns and Roses, Apache by The Shadows - which inspired Dave to play guitar - and Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb. Hazel O'Connor's 1980 hit Will You? is dedicated to his wife and mother to their two children. An ode to tentative yet powerful romantic tension, it is known for its saxophone solo - an instrument Dave also learned to play. \"It's our tune from when we got together,\" Dave explains, tapping his feet. As the song evokes memories, his wife Kate quietly adds \"the fight was worth it.\" Moments like this emphasise the power of music to forge everlasting connection. Its therapeutic benefits are increasingly recognisedin palliative and end of life care. The impact is neurological as well as emotional, explains Sarah Metcalfe, managing director of the Utley Foundation's Music for Dementia campaign. Brain activity scans show music \"lights up\" multiple parts of our brain, simultaneously touching physical and emotional sense centres. \"Even if one part of the brain is damaged, those other parts can still be accessed,\" Sarah says. UK charity Marie Curiesurveyed 1,000 adults whose loved ones had received care in the final stages of life. It found listening to music together helped to create a shared experience that brought them closer, creating a sense of normality and helping them relax. Kate experienced this first hand. When Dave once returned home after a lengthy hospital stay, he was twitchy and exhausted but unable to sleep. Out of desperation she turned to Native American music, one of his favourite genres to relax to. \"And then all of a sudden, this agitated, anxious man began to sleep,\" she recalls. Diana Schad, a staff nurse at the Marie Curie hospice in Glasgow with 19 years of experience as well as a musician herself, has installed a piano for patients and volunteers to use. She says it is important to consider the feelings music evokes. \"You've always got to ask yourself, is this what they would like to be feeling at the moment?\" says Diana. 1. Focus on music memories between ages 10-30, which is when the strongest associations are formed 2. Include songs connected to special, significant places and important life events - youth, holidays, romance, first dances and wedding songs 3. Consider feelings sparked by songs - these can be just as powerful as memory association 4. Remember that music can trigger memories even for people with conditions like dementia by connecting multiple brain regions.Use resources like BBC Music Memoriesto spark memory recall 5. Be open to unexpected musical connections, like TV show themes or commercial jingles that might hold special meaning Source: Music for Dementia's managing director, Sarah Metcalfe Experts agree that music can reduce anxiety and psychological pain, even when someone is unconscious. Dr Sam Murphy, senior lecturer at the Open University, specialises in thanatology, the study of death and the practices associated with it. \"There's certainly evidence to suggest that hearing is the last sense to go so even when someone is unconscious or unresponsive, music can still reach them,\" she says. \"It keeps them connected to their surroundings, to the people they love, and to the sense of being alive and those memories that they've had.\" Music can be equally helpful to loved ones after a person has passed away. \"I think it's just another distraction for those people that are mourning a loved one,\" Dr Murphy says. \"But there's that comfort in knowing that they're listening to something that their loved one would have listened to over the years.\" This is true for Anna-Kay Brocklesby, whose husband Ian passed away from prostate cancer in 2023. As Ian's health deteriorated, sharing his favourite songs became a crucial part of their family's coping mechanism. It became a way to keep spirits up and stay positive, says his wife. \"Every morning he would go down and make the tea, he would play. Oh, What a Beautiful Morning from the musical Oklahoma,\" she says. \"And he would belt it out. He used it as a sort of mindset of, this is how today's going to be\". They would play Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, and Elton John songs, which provided comfort and connection. Two years after Ian died, Anna-Kay still finds comfort in the music they shared together. \"He lives on in us in many, many ways,\" says Anna-Kay, \"but music can take us to a place with Ian\".

Using an undercover reporter, we discovered the network promised to pay participants if they posted pro-Russian propaganda and fake news undermining Moldova's pro-EU ruling party ahead of the country's 28 September parliamentary ballot. Participants were paid to find supporters of Moldova's pro-Russia opposition to secretly record - and also to carry out a so-called poll. This was done in the name of a non-existent organisation, making it illegal. The results of this selective sampling, an organiser from the network suggested, could lay the groundwork to question the outcome of the election. The results of the so-called poll, suggesting the ruling party will lose, have already been published online. In fact, official polls suggest the ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) founded by President Maia Sandu is currently ahead of the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc (BEP). We have found links between the secret network and Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor - sanctioned by the US for \"the Kremlin's malign influence operations\" and now a fugitive in Moscow. The UK has also sanctioned him for corruption. We have also found links between the network and a non-profit organisation (NGO) called Evrazia. Evrazia has connections to Mr Shor and was sanctioned by the UK, US and EU for allegedly bribing Moldovan citizens to vote against EU membership last year. The referendum on joining passed,but by a very small margin. \"In 2024 the focus of [Ilan Shor's] campaign was money. This year the focus is disinformation,\" Moldova's chief of police, Viorel Cernauteanu, told the BBC World Service. We asked Ilan Shor and Evrazia to respond to our investigation findings - they did not provide a response. Moldova may be small, but sandwiched between Ukraine, and EU-member Romania, it has strategic significance for both Europe and the Kremlin, experts say. The World Service infiltrated the network - co-ordinated on the messaging app Telegram - through a link sent to us by a whistleblower. This gave us a crucial insight into how an anti-democratic propaganda network operates. Our undercover reporter Ana, and 34 other recruits, were asked to attend secret online seminars which would \"prepare operatives\". With titles like \"How to go from your kitchen to national leader\", they seemed to serve as a vetting process. Ana and the others had to pass regular tests on what they had learned. Our reporter was then contacted by a network co-ordinator called Alina Juc. Ms Juc's social media profile says she is from Transnistria, a separatist region of eastern Moldova loyal to Moscow, and her Instagram shows she has made multiple trips to Russia over the past few years. Ms Juc told Ana she would be paid 3,000 Moldovan lei ($170, £125) a month to produce TikTok and Facebook posts in the run-up to the election, and that she would be sent the money from Promsvyazbank (PSB) - a sanctioned Russian state-owned bank which acts as the official bank for the Russian defence ministry, and is a shareholder in one of Ilan Shor's companies. Ana and the other recruits were trained to produce social media posts using ChatGPT. Content \"attracts people if the picture contains some satire… over reality\", they were told, but that too much AI should be avoided to ensure posts felt \"organic\". Inside the Telegram group, Ana and the BBC had access to previous instructions issued to participants. Initially, they had been asked for patriotic posts about historical figures in Moldovan history - but gradually the demands had become overtly political. Ana was asked to post unfounded allegations - including that Moldova's current government is planning to falsify the election results, Moldova's potential EU membership is contingent on the country changing its \"sexual orientation\" to LGBT, and that President Sandu is facilitating child trafficking. Social media campaigns are now frequently central to national elections. We monitored the social media posts supporting Moldova's ruling party PAS, but did not uncover any obvious disinformation campaign. Throughout our undercover exercise with the network we only shared posts which were factually accurate, and we limited their number. We wanted to find out who else was in the network, as we had evidence it was made up of multiple groups similar to the one we infiltrated. We looked for patterns of similar activity across other accounts that we could monitor through our Telegram access. The network, we concluded, is made up of at least 90 TikTok accounts - some masquerading as news outlets - which have posted thousands of videos totalling more than 23 million views and 860,000 likes since January. Moldova's population is just 2.4 million. We shared our findings with US-based Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), and it told us its analysis shows the network could be even bigger. The broader network has amassed more than 55 million views and over 2.2 million likes on TikTok since January, DFRLab found. The network did not just post disinformation. Ms Juc also offered Ana 200 Moldovan lei ($12, £9) an hour in cash to conduct unofficial polling, interviewing people in Moldova's capital about their preferred candidates in the election. Before conducting this task, participants were given training on how to subtly sway those being polled. They were also asked to secretly tape the interviewees who said they supported the pro-Russian opposition. Ms Juc revealed this was to \"prevent the vote from being rigged\" suggesting the survey results and the secret recordings would be used, in the event of a PAS victory, as supposed evidence that it won unfairly. Our evidence also suggests the network our reporter joined is being bank-rolled from Russia. Ana overheard - and filmed - Alina Juc on the phone asking for money from Moscow. \"Listen, can you bring money from Moscow… I just need to give my people their salaries,\" we filmed her saying. It was not clear who would be sending her the money, but we have found links between the network and Ilan Shor via NGO Evrazia. Ilan Shor and Evrazia did not respond to our investigation findings. The BBC found photos of Ana's handler, Alina Juc, on Evrazia's website - and one of the Telegram groups Ana was added to was called \"Evrazia leaders.\" The UK Foreign Office says Evrazia operates \"in Moldova on behalf of corrupt fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor… to destabilise Moldovan democracy.\" We asked Alina Juc to comment on our findings - she did not respond. TikTok said it had implemented additional safety and security measures ahead of the elections and continued to \"aggressively counter deceptive behaviour\". Facebook's owner Meta did not respond to our findings. The Russian embassy in the UK denied involvement in fake news and electoral interference and claimed that it was the EU that had been interfering in Moldova's election.

In an interview with BBC Newsnight, the former vice-president to Donald Trump said he would like to see negotiations to lower the levies. The new detention facility inside the prison is designed to hold more than 400 undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes. Jackson Denio, a 13-year-old from New Hampshire, might have set the world record for the largest catch of a halibut fish. The US president made the remarks during a dinner hosting prominent tech leaders at the White House. Trump has said \"we're going in\", when asked about sending National Guard troops to Chicago, but does he have the power to do this? Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

                                                                                                                            Rohan Mehta - not his real name - spent over $8,000 (£5,900) on flights in his scramble to get back to the US ahead of a deadline that would dramatically increase visa fees for some. He had been in Nagpur, India for the anniversary of his father's death before he cut his trip short. On Friday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding a $100,000 (£74,000) fee for applicants to the visa programme for skilled foreign workers which US-based companies would have to pay. Companies and immigration lawyers had already advised those on the H-1B visa who were outside the US to return before the order came into force Sunday. A day later, the White House clarified it would be a one-time fee and would not apply to current visa holders, but it was too late for some. Workers from India receive by far the most skilled visas in the programme, at more than 70% of the 85,000 issued each year. Despite the clarification posted on X by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, concern and confusion had already spread. The BBC spoke to many H-1B visa holders from India. Many have been working in the US for decades. None wanted to be identified as they were not authorised by their employers. Many refused to speak to us entirely. Rohan Mehta, a software professional, has lived in the US with his family for 11 years but had travelled to Nagpur at the beginning of the month to see relatives commemorating his father's death. But on 20 September, he said he feared he would not be able to return to his home if he did not get back before the deadline. He spent over $8,000 (£5,900) in eight hours booking and rebooking return flights to the US. \"I booked multiple options because most were cutting it very close,\" he said just after he had boarded a Virgin Atlantic flight from Mumbai to John F. Kennedy International Airport. \"Even if there was a slight delay, I'd have missed the deadline.\" In its clarification, the White House said the new fee, which is more than 60 times the amount currently charged, would not be enforced until the next round of visa applications was approved. Rohan Mehta described the last few days as \"traumatic\" adding he was glad his wife and daughter had not come to India with him on this trip. \"I'm regretting the choices I've made in life. I gave the prime of my youth to working for this country [the US] and now I feel like I'm not wanted. \"My daughter has spent her entire life in the US. I'm not sure how I'll uproot my life from there and start all over in India.\" The H-1B is a work visa programme for people looking to work in the US in specialised fields and roles. Employers are able to sponsor professionals to get them into the country with a job offer required for the application. According to government statistics, the greatest beneficiary of the programme the previous fiscal year was Amazon, followed by tech giants Tata, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google. Another visa holder who was on holiday in Europe agreed there was confusion. \"We are yet to see how employers are thinking and how this will play out. \"From my understanding, the order is only for new H-1B visas. Immigration lawyers are still figuring it out and have advised us to go back.\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X clarifying some details including that it would not be an annual fee, just a one-off. She wrote: \"Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will not be charged $100,000 to re-enter. \"H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would.\" She added that the new fee would only apply to \"new visas, not renewals, and not current visa holders\". The former deputy PM says Starmer and Trump's relationship is \"getting a bit embarrassing\". Kirk's widow, Erika, also delivers a tearful speech, saying she forgives her husband's alleged killer. The BBC spoke to Americans who travelled to Arizona to attend the late conservative activist's memorial service. The five-hour service saw top officials from the Trump administration pay tribute to the conservative activist.

And I'm far from alone - creatine has become the supplement of choice for millions. Originally known for enhancing the performance of bodybuilders and athletes in the 1990s, this white powder is now entering the spice cupboards (well, that's where I store mine) of women in their 40s. It's arguably one of the world's most researched supplements. Thousands of studies have been carried out over the past few decades evaluating its ability to increase muscle mass and overall strength. \"Creatine has become so big, you feel that if you are not using it, you are kind of losing out,\" says Dr Henry Chung, a lecturer in sport and exercise science at the University of Essex. \"It's moved from elite sport into the mainstream. It's not about whether to take it anymore, it's about when to take it - before or after exercise? Everyday? How much? \"In which form is best? Powder, tablets, gummies?\" Creatine is a naturally occurring compound which is stored in our muscles, and helps our cells produce energy. It is a vital component in the ATP-CP system, the fastest, most powerful energy system in our bodies. It fuels the first 10-20 seconds in high intensity workouts - giving that quick, powerful burst of energy. From lifting weights to sprinting round the track, research suggestscreatine supplementation can help improve performance. And away from the gym, there is a growing, but still relatively limited, body of evidence to suggest it can also help with ourshort-term memory, mood and focus. So, can this supplement improve our ability to think, remember and respond? And for me, and many others, will it help clear our brain fog, a catch-all term that describes an inability to think clearly, string a sentence together, and remember the simplest of things? For some people with serious post-viral conditions, brain fog can be longer term and potentially life-changing. If you have concerns, it is best to seek medical help. For most, brain fog is usually temporary and can happen because of an illness or certain types of medical treatment. For millions of women, it can be a symptom of the perimenopause, due to hormonal fluctuations. Katie Mansell believes creatine has helped in many parts of her life. The 46-year-old from Merseyside lifts weights, runs 30-40 miles a week, has a full-on job as the chief financial officer of a software company, and a busy home life with a teenage son and two dogs. \"A few months ago, I was out of sorts. I was finding training really hard work and I was struggling to focus on things,\" she says. \"It was my friend who recommended it - she said it was a game changer.\" Katie, who is also perimenopausal, started taking six grams of creatine a day three months ago, and is beginning to feel a difference. Her mood feels a bit lighter, she can lift heavier weights and the fog that had descended on her brain has started to lift. \"I've got more motivation to do things, especially when it comes to training. I feel stronger when I'm lifting and bouldering, and I can also think more clearly.\" Katie does caveat this - she's also on magnesium supplements and has started on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), but she's confident that creatine is making an impact and will continue with her daily dose. There are others who believe it's made little difference and there is divided opinion on whether the majority of us get the amount of creatine we need through our diets. Katie, who is a vegetarian, says she was probably missing out. While it's understood our bodies produce one gram of it naturally, the rest comes from high-protein food like meat and fish. The supplement's impact on male athletes has been documented since the early 1990s but, as with a lot of scientific research, female biology was missing from the equation. \"I used to have to guess what my female athletes needed,\" explains Dr Susan Kleiner, a high-performance nutritionist from the US state of Washington. \"All the research was based on men.\" It wasn't until a few years ago that women's hormonal fluctuations were taken into account, says Dr Kleiner, an adviser on the board of Creatine Health, a global initiative set up to promote research on the supplement. \"And that was when scientists started to see a real impact in other parts of the body.\" Instead of just concentrating on how creatine interacts with our muscles in a sport setting, scientists have begun to discover how it could potentially affect reproductive health, bone health and brain function - all of which can be affected during perimenopause, she explains. So does that mean that creatine can help my brain fog? \"That's an interesting thought,\" says Professor Emeritus Trevor McMorris. \"It might do.\" Having been in the field for more than 40 years, he has carried out many studies into creatine supplementation. He says perimenopausal brain fog could have a similar impact to sleep deprivation, something he has researched extensively,finding that high doses of creatine could mitigate the effects of too little sleep. When people use the supplement, the brain may - like our muscles - increase its stores of creatine. This helps produce more energy, which could help improve memory and the ability to process information. But Prof McMorris say it won't work for everyone. His most recent research suggestspeople need to be under a level of stress- for example, being sleep deprived or not having enough creatine in their diet - for it to make a difference. So, in short, when it comes to helping me with my brain fog - maybe - there's potential. The experts I have spoken to believe it's an \"an exciting time\" in this line of research, but that more studies are needed. Dietician Lucy Upton warns that we could start to see more side effects to creatine use because of the supplement's surge in popularity. \"While there is extensive research, that has been in a controlled environment,\" she says. \"Now we need to think about the variation of body sizes, doses and any pre-existing conditions.\" Currently, known side effects are the risk of stomach upset, muscle cramps and bloating. People with conditions affecting their kidneys should consult a doctor before taking it. While Dr Chung sees no harm in healthy adults \"trying it out\", he also says results tend to be \"minimal gains\", adding that \"it is not, by any means, a wonder drug\". As for me, I started taking the creatine in my cupboard but stopped after a month (blame it on the brain fog). Perhaps I'll give it another try.

            "20  What would you do if you were stuck on a ship, far from loved ones, and you had no idea how - or when - you'd get home? A BBC podcast follows the story of how one young woman's life took an unexpectedly wild turn. It is New Year's Eve 2019 and Giulia Baccosi is at a party with friends when her phone pings. The 31-year-old has recently accepted a new job in Sicily, but isn't sure she's made the right call. \"My heart was telling me maybe I should reconsider,\" Giulia says. \"I look up at the sky and ask the universe for a sign - to let me know if I am on the right path.\" The message that flashes up on Giulia's phone is from a friend. It says a cargo ship carrying rum and olive oil from Europe to Central America is about to set sail - and it needs a cook. Giulia has previously worked as a ship's cook and decides she'll take this new job rather than the one in Sicily. \"I'll come with you to Mexico,\" she says on the phone to the ship's owner, \"and then I'll leave.\" It is anticipated this leg of the voyage will take about three months - after which Giulia plans to return to her life in Italy. But that's not how things work out. In early January, excitement builds aboard the Avontuur - a 100-year-old schooner - as it sets sail from Germany and heads towards the rough waters of the North Sea. Giulia will be cooking three meals a day for the hungry crew and managing supplies. The first port of call is Santa Cruz de Tenerife and as the Avontuur approaches, the crew can hear the distant drums of the city's enormous carnival. After 36 days at sea, everyone is keen to let their hair down. Once on shore the crew find themselves surrounded by thousands of revellers in dazzling outfits. \"We were just like, 'What to do? Let's join the party!'\" Giulia remembers. The following morning, slightly hungover, a rumour reaches them about some holidaymakers on the island who have fallen ill with a mystery virus and been quarantined in their hotel. But it is soon forgotten as the crew prepare to set sail again. One morning soon after, as Giulia is chopping fruit and stirring porridge, the night watch tells her about an unusual little light that's been spotted on the horizon. The Avontuur is 45 nautical miles off the coast of Gran Canaria and the light is too far out to be a fishing boat. Suddenly commands are shouted, sails are dropped, and the engine - used only in emergencies - is turned on. \"What is happening?\" Giulia says. \"Is this really what I think it is?\" As the light comes closer, she sees a small, wooden fishing vessel with five women and 11 men on board, packed so tightly they can barely stand. \"They are waving,\" Giulia says, \"from a distance we can hear them shouting.\" As the Avontuur approaches, the people onboard the tiny boat become increasingly distressed. \"They all wanted to be the first one out of that nightmare,\" Giulia says. \"They are the most fragile and vulnerable version of a human being you can be.\" The boat's occupants have been drifting at sea for more than 10 days and have run out of water, food, and fuel. The crossing they have tried to make, from West Africa to the Canaries, is one of the most dangerous in the world. Tens of thousands attempt this journey each year, and thousands die. Brought aboard the Avontuur, the exhausted migrants are fed, watered and given medical attention. \"I remember one of them telling me, 'I didn't know the sea was so big,'\" Giuila says. The Avontuur can't carry an extra 16 passengers, so the coastguard is called. \"There are no heroes... none of us feels like one,\" Giulia later writes in her diary. \"We did what every decent human being should - and would - do in our place.\" Days later, the Avontuur is back out in the Atlantic, when the crew is asked to gather on deck. The captain reads out an email from the ship's owner. \"The world as you know it no longer exists,\" the email begins. \"Ports are closing, airports are closing, flights are cancelled. Supermarkets, shops, borders - everything has shut.\" There is a moment of silence. \"We were all looking at each other a bit astonished, a bit confused,\" Giulia says. \"What is happening to the people we love that are [back] at home?\" The world is beginning to lock down because of Covid - but no one really understands yet exactly what this means. \"I wanted to talk with my boyfriend, I wanted to call my mum, my grandma, my brother,\" Giulia says. \"I was grabbed by the fear that something would happen to them while I was out in the ocean and I can't even speak to them one last time.\" The crew's only point of contact with the rest of the world is a single daily satellite email that connects the ship to its headquarters in Germany. Phone signal is still at least six days away. Unsure if they will now be allowed to dock anywhere, the Avontuur sails on towards the Caribbean. As the ship nears Guadeloupe, Giulia sits on deck clutching her phone, waiting for a signal. When the call finally connects she explodes in tears. \"What are you going to do?\" Giulia's partner asks. \"I have no idea about anything at all,\" she replies. \"Nobody does.\" Normally arrival in a new port means loading and unloading cargo, shore leave, and ordering provisions. For the crew it should be an opportunity to rest, walk on dry land, make phone calls, send messages, and take time for themselves. \"If you have a ship you are sharing with 15 people - you are never more than a few metres away from all the other humans you are living with,\" Giulia says. There seems to be little activity at Guadeloupe port, but eventually staff wearing surgical masks approach. They ask the Avontuur to depart Guadeloupe as soon as possible, leaving the ship's crew in disbelief. Denied shore leave after more than three weeks at sea and still reeling from the news the world is in lockdown, the crew are concerned about what lies ahead. Their next port of call, Honduras, could be as much as a fortnight away. \"Is it really wise to keep going?\" Giulia says. In the weeks that follow, while people on dry land are denied the ability to mix freely, the Avontuur's crew are prevented from stepping ashore at most ports. It becomes clear any planned arrivals and departures to and from the ship - including Giulia's plan to leave in Mexico - are off the table. It also seems unlikely anyone will be able to set foot on dry land at any port, until the Avontuur is back in Germany. This means sourcing food becomes increasingly difficult, leaving Giulia worried about how she will continue to feed the 15-strong crew, now confined to a space roughly the size of a basketball court - and among whom tensions are growing. Giulia's thoughts return repeatedly to her loved ones. She drafts a message, ready to post on Instagram. \"It feels quite surreal to be confined on this floating bubble,\" she writes. \"I hope you are all safe and sound out there.\" To fight boredom and anxiety, the crew embrace crafts, drawing, and playing instruments. They rig a cargo net to swim safely off the stern. Some find a release in romantic relationships. \"There is chemistry, there is attraction,\" Giulia says. \"To look for physical intimacy and physical touch is very human. In those moments you can forget there is something outside that you can't control.\" The crew also find comfort in the wonders of the ocean - dolphins and flying fish - and one night have an encounter with a pod of friendly minke whales, swimming in bio-luminescent water. \"They are so close we can smell their breath,\" Giulia says. \"The most beautiful moment - which is so magnificent and marvellous and dreamy - and yet, it smells of farts.\" At one point the Avontuur has to take evasive action to avoid a hurricane and sails as far north as Newfoundland - off the coast of Canada. Fresh food is now running out and when Giulia makes an inventory she realises there is not enough dry food to make it back to Germany. Some items, including coffee - \"the one thing that propels a sailor\" -  must be rationed. Then Giulia discovers the gas is also running out. \"It is our main energy to cook,\" Giulia says, \"and we don't have any plan B.\" An improvised fireless slow cooker is built from little more than a wooden box, expanding foam, and a yoga mat - and it works. \"Somehow, out of a very serious and worrying situation, we end up enjoying some of the best stew I've ever cooked in my life,\" she says. In June 2020 the Avontuur finally makes landfall in Horta, in the Azores - a lush, volcanic archipelago off the west coast of Portugal. The crew, all EU citizens, should be allowed ashore - but first, they must test for Covid. Days later, the call comes. After four and a half months at sea, they're permitted to land - and Giulia wants to savour every moment. \"I want the flowers, I want the grass, I want the bar, I want the people, I want to go and buy some chocolate,\" she says, \"the possibility to walk and decide if you are going to turn left or right.\" Good spirits return among the crew, and they begin to look forward to the final leg of their journey, back towards Europe. \"We know that we are sailing home,\" Giulia says. At the end of July, after 188 days at sea, the Avontuur finally approaches the port of Hamburg in Germany. The crew hold hands as the ship docks. \"My eyes filled with tears,\" Giulia says. \"We have been waiting for this for so long - and now it is real.\" But there is still work to do. The ship's hold is full of sacks and the 15 sailors must unload the 64 tonnes of olive oil, coffee, cacao, and rum brought from the Caribbean. \"Our duty is done - it is time to celebrate!\" Giulia says. At a homecoming party the crew wear T-shirts printed with the words, \"The world as you know it no longer exists\" - but Giulia feels changed. \"I am back, but I am not the same as before,\" she says. \"I wonder how I will fit - as a new me - in my old life.\" Despite the wild turn Giulia's voyage on the Avontuur took, it didn't put her off a life at sea. She never expected to still be working as a ship's cook, but five years on, she's aboard another boat, somewhere off the coast of Greenland. And every now and then, just as she did on New Year's Eve five years ago, Giulia looks up at the sky and asks the universe for a sign - to make sure she's on the right path. There has been strong opposition against the airport wanting to use its northern runway. The work will improve safety and capacity around J6 of the M42, National Highways says.

But so are fathers. Abdel Aziz Majarmeh was standing next to his 13-year-old son, Islam, as he was shot dead by Israeli forces this month at the entrance to Jenin refugee camp, in the occupied West Bank. \"My son fell to the ground, and then I heard the sound of a shot,\" he said. \"An army jeep came up and five or six soldiers pointed their weapons at me, telling me to leave. I didn't even know my son was martyred. I started dragging him away.\" Abdel Aziz said he had gone to the camp – occupied by Israel's army since January – to retrieve family documents from his home there. \"There is no-one for me to complain to,\" he told me. \"They control everything. The Palestinian Authority can't even protect itself – it only implements the decisions of the Jews.\" As a Palestinian, Abdel Aziz is resigned to his powerlessness. As a father, he's tormented. \"In my mind, I keep asking that soldier, 'why pick on a 13-year-old boy? I'm standing right next to him. Shoot me. Why are you shooting children? I'm here, shoot me'.\" Israel's army said it had fired to neutralise a threat posed by suspects who had approached them in a closed military area, and was examining the incident. It refused to clarify what threat the teenager had posed. Cities like Jenin were put under the full control of the Palestinian Authority three decades ago, under the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo Peace Accords. They were meant to be the seeds from which statehood would grow. But Israel says it was terrorism that flourished there. In January, it sent tanks into Jenin and the neighbouring city of Tulkarem to crush armed Palestinian groups, saying it would apply lessons learned in Gaza. Since then, Israeli forces have remained, razing large areas of the camps in both cities, and demolishing buildings in other areas. The UK, Canada and Australia have now recognised a Palestinian state with others set to follow. This all against a backdrop of Israeli control spreading across the West Bank and the Gaza war grinding on. Jenin's mayor, Mohammed Jarrar, took me to the camp entrance near where Islam was shot. The army vehicles stationed here on my previous visits are nowhere to be seen, but a large earth berm now blocks the road in, and locals say Israeli snipers still scan the area from the buildings overhead. Mr Jarrar told me around 40% of Jenin was now a military area for Israeli forces, with around a quarter of residents – including the entire camp – displaced from their homes. \"It was clear from the beginning this was a major political plan, not a security operation,\" he told me. \"This Israeli government wants to annex the West Bank and in preparation for that, it wants to prevent any [armed] opposition to its plan.\" Israel has also placed the Palestinian Authority under a long-term economic siege, withholding tax revenues the PA needs to pay teachers and police. Israel accuses it of funding terrorism by compensating the families of Palestinian militants who are killed. The PA says it has now scrapped that payment scheme. Mr Jarrar said it was now very challenging to provide even basic services to the local population, and to persuade young people not to leave. Against this backdrop, he said, the recognition of a Palestinian state by Britain, France and others is important, even after more than 140 other nations have already done so. \"It confirms the fact that the Palestinian people possess a state, even if it is under occupation,\" he told me. \"I know that this recognition will lead to [greater] occupation of the West Bank. But even so I believe recognition is more important, because it will shape the future of the Palestinian people, and the international community will be called on to defend their rights.\" Recognition of a Palestinian state by the UK and France is also a recognition of the political chasm between Israel and its European allies over this issue. \"There will be no Palestinian state,\" Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told settlers in the West Bank last week. \"This place is ours. We will see to our heritage, our land and our security.\" Netanyahu has built his career on preventing a Palestinian state, and his government has pushed hard on expanding settlements in the West Bank. His far-right allies have been pushing for formal annexation, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich recently outlining a plan to annex 82% of West Bank, with the remaining Palestinian enclaves cut off from each other. US President Donald Trump has opposed the recognition of a Palestinian state, but has not publicly criticised Israeli moves towards annexation. Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, and has never left. Establishing civilian settlements on occupied land is illegal under the Geneva Conventions, but Israel argues that it has a historic Jewish right to the West Bank. Around half a million settlers now live there, and the Israeli organisation, Peace Now, which tracks settlement expansion, says more than 100 new outposts have appeared across the West Bank in the past two years. Outposts are illegal under both international and Israeli law, but they receive tacit approval from Netanyahu's government as well as state support in the form of roads, security and utilities. Earlier this summer, Ayman Soufan saw new neighbours arrive on the hill next to his house, in the hills south of Nablus. From his window, he and his grandchildren have a clear view of the simple wooden shelter and corrugated iron shed put up by Israeli settlers that Ayman says are from the nearby settlement of Yitzhar. \"This outpost they set up here is to push us out of our house. Every day a settler comes, bangs on the house, shouting 'leave, leave!',\" he told me.  \"They throw their garbage at our doorstep. I call the authorities and they say, \"We'll send the army\".  But the army never comes. The settlers are the army, they are the police, they are everything.\" Ayman's family built this house, near the village of Burin, a few years after Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967. Israel was temporarily given control over rural areas like this under the Oslo peace accords, with the intention that they would eventually be transferred to a future Palestinian State, after negotiations over settlements there. But Israeli control has remained, settlements have mushroomed, and human rights groups say Israeli forces are increasingly supportive of settler attacks. Ayman said his father had died from a heart attack as settlers set fire to the house in 2003, and that his home had been torched several more times since then. \"Who is supposed to protect me,\" Ayman asked. \"The Palestinian police? They can't even prevent this happening in the cities, how will they come here? Here, my security is in the hands of the people who occupy me.\" International recognition of a Palestinian state is a good thing, he says, even if little will change on the ground. \"What's coming is worse,\" he said. \"But if I ever leave this house, it'll be when I'm carried out dead. This house where I was born, where I grew up and lived my childhood; every corner has a memory for me. How can I leave it?\" In the decades since the Oslo Accords, Israeli narratives have hardened, armed Palestinian groups have strengthened, and the control of the Palestinian Authority government has been eaten away. \"Palestine was never theirs and will never be theirs,\" said bereaved father Abdel Aziz Majarmeh. \"Sooner or later, today, tomorrow, in a year or two, they will leave this country. And Palestine will be liberated.\" The UK and France have clung to the idea that two separate states – Israeli and Palestinian – are the solution to the conflict here, even as Palestinian territory was taken, and Palestinian institutions undermined. Now the Gaza war, and questions over who will govern Gaza afterwards, have forced that political gridlock into open confrontation, as Netanyahu's far-right allies push hard for annexation. Some Israelis say the West Bank is like the Wild West: a place where statehood and sovereignty are decided not by laws and declarations but by facts on the ground. Israel has long argued there can be no Palestinian state without its agreement. Now, by pushing ahead with recognition, the UK, France and others are signalling that Israel can't cancel statehood alone. A political fact by Israel's allies to counter its facts on the ground. Canada, Australia and Portugal also announced the move on Sunday, with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu accusing leaders of giving a \"huge reward to terrorism\". After Canada, the UK and Australia also announced they'd taken the major step of recognition, which Israel has decried as rewarding terror.

With the president approaching 90 years of age and another possible candidate in jail, finding the right leadership would be a challenge The UK, Australia and Canada have recognised a Palestinian state, while France and other countries are set to do so in the coming days.

                                                                                                                            Rohan Mehta - not his real name - spent over $8,000 (£5,900) on flights in his scramble to get back to the US ahead of a deadline that would dramatically increase visa fees for some. He had been in Nagpur, India for the anniversary of his father's death before he cut his trip short. On Friday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding a $100,000 (£74,000) fee for applicants to the visa programme for skilled foreign workers which US-based companies would have to pay. Companies and immigration lawyers had already advised those on the H-1B visa who were outside the US to return before the order came into force Sunday. A day later, the White House clarified it would be a one-time fee and would not apply to current visa holders, but it was too late for some. Workers from India receive by far the most skilled visas in the programme, at more than 70% of the 85,000 issued each year. Despite the clarification posted on X by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, concern and confusion had already spread. The BBC spoke to many H-1B visa holders from India. Many have been working in the US for decades. None wanted to be identified as they were not authorised by their employers. Many refused to speak to us entirely. Rohan Mehta, a software professional, has lived in the US with his family for 11 years but had travelled to Nagpur at the beginning of the month to see relatives commemorating his father's death. But on 20 September, he said he feared he would not be able to return to his home if he did not get back before the deadline. He spent over $8,000 (£5,900) in eight hours booking and rebooking return flights to the US. \"I booked multiple options because most were cutting it very close,\" he said just after he had boarded a Virgin Atlantic flight from Mumbai to John F. Kennedy International Airport. \"Even if there was a slight delay, I'd have missed the deadline.\" In its clarification, the White House said the new fee, which is more than 60 times the amount currently charged, would not be enforced until the next round of visa applications was approved. Rohan Mehta described the last few days as \"traumatic\" adding he was glad his wife and daughter had not come to India with him on this trip. \"I'm regretting the choices I've made in life. I gave the prime of my youth to working for this country [the US] and now I feel like I'm not wanted. \"My daughter has spent her entire life in the US. I'm not sure how I'll uproot my life from there and start all over in India.\" The H-1B is a work visa programme for people looking to work in the US in specialised fields and roles. Employers are able to sponsor professionals to get them into the country with a job offer required for the application. According to government statistics, the greatest beneficiary of the programme the previous fiscal year was Amazon, followed by tech giants Tata, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google. Another visa holder who was on holiday in Europe agreed there was confusion. \"We are yet to see how employers are thinking and how this will play out. \"From my understanding, the order is only for new H-1B visas. Immigration lawyers are still figuring it out and have advised us to go back.\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X clarifying some details including that it would not be an annual fee, just a one-off. She wrote: \"Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will not be charged $100,000 to re-enter. \"H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would.\" She added that the new fee would only apply to \"new visas, not renewals, and not current visa holders\". The former deputy PM says Starmer and Trump's relationship is \"getting a bit embarrassing\". Kirk's widow, Erika, also delivers a tearful speech, saying she forgives her husband's alleged killer. The BBC spoke to Americans who travelled to Arizona to attend the late conservative activist's memorial service. The five-hour service saw top officials from the Trump administration pay tribute to the conservative activist. Lower consumer taxes are expected to ease some of the impact of Trump's 50% tariffs on India. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

When a Russian missile damaged Natalia Grishko's apartment in a tower block on the outskirts of Kyiv last November she thankfully was not injured. Mrs Grishko's daughter, Alina Kalcheva, says the missile fell about 100m (328ft) from the building. \"The blast wave damaged my mother's balcony, windows, doors, and the interior of the apartment.\" While her mum was \"of course very upset and cried\" to begin with, Mrs Kalcheva says she ultimately felt calm because they had insured the flat against such an attack. For while general household insurance doesn't cover conflict damage – whether you live in Ukraine or a country not under attack - Mrs Kalcheva had had the foresight to take out specialist war risk insurance cover for her mother. And the insurer paid out $1,000 (£740) to help cover the repairs. The annual premium or cost was $52, and the 33-year-old says she \"didn't hesitate to buy it. And as it turned out it was obviously the right decision.\" Fellow Ukrainian Ekaterina Vasylieva even took out a war risk policy for her car in April 2024. That was particularly timely, because only a day later her vehicle was damaged by Russian shrapnel when it was parked in a street in the coastal city of Odesa. \"Only the day before I extended the comprehensive insurance on the car, and the manager offered for me to get insurance against military risks,\" she says. \"The cover saved me a lot because after the Russian attack the car looked like a sieve.\" War risk insurance is the general term for a sector that also offers cover against terrorism. Industry experts say it has grown exponentially since the September 11 attacks in the US back in 2001. And while individuals can take out war risk cover, the vast majority of policies are bought by companies who wish to insure their operations, facilities and staff around the world. Especially in high-risk countries and regions. Although data is hard to come by for an industry that doesn't seek the limelight, one trade publication this year estimated that the global amount spent on taking out war risk insurance now totals about$1bn (£800m) per annum. And £621m, or nearly 80%, of that figure is said to go to specialist insurers in the City of London, which is the centre of the international war risk insurance market. Joanna Cousins heads a nine-person political violence and war team at one such London-based insurer – Westfield Speciality. She cites the example of a large energy facility in Iraq, owned by a Western company, which has been attacked multiple times in recent years. Mrs Cousins says that the owner ultimately bought more than £100m of war risk cover, without which it would have \"ceased or greatly reduced\" the operation of the site. People in the war risk market are not normally very keen to talk about how much a policy costs. But for a British or American company operating in Lebanon or Israel, \"currently, premiums are priced between 0.5% and 2% of the total cover they buy,\" says a senior London war risk insurance underwriter who asked not to be named. An underwriter is a finance professional who determines the level of risk of an insurance application, and then calculates what the cost of the cover will be. The 0.5% to 2% range means that if a business wants £100m of annual cover it has to pay between £500,000 and £2m. However, these rates will \"fluctuate significantly as the situation in different countries in the Middle East is volatile\", adds the unnamed underwriter. Premiums in stable Gulf states are said to be much lower, from 0.025% to 0.05% of the total amount covered. What is actually covered by a policy can vary. For example, a company can get cover for kidnappings and ransoms, treating serious injuries, or the cost of dealing with an \"active assailant\" situation. \"The market is growing in capacity and demand, \" says Daniel Hiller, underwriter, and group head of terrorism and political violence at insurer Munich Re Specialty. \"There are more perils customers can buy coverage for, especially around the active shooter product, but also strikes and riots.\" War risk cover is organised in seven \"buckets\" spanning different severities of conflict. Sabotage and terrorism are considered to be the lowest, while civil and interstate war are the highest. \"Many insurers try to offer all this coverage, since often it's not clear where a situation has moved from risk of terrorism, to civil war, to even interstate war,\" says Raveem Ismail, founder of specialist insurance firm London-based Trigger Parametric. The war risk sector is centred on London due to the continuing strength of Lloyds of London, which has been a specialist insurance market since 1689. Lloyds is also home to war risk insurance reinsurers – firms who buy and sell the cover. Ms Cousins says this spreads out the possible exposure. \"Each [reinsurer] covers a certain percentage of the risk, of anywhere between one and 10%,\" she says. Constantin Gurdgiev, a finance professor at the University of Northern Colorado, and an expert in the study of risk and conflict finance, says the challenge for the war risk sector is to work out what premium to charge for cover. \"Wars and conflicts more generally represent black swan [very rare] events,\" he says. Because of this rarity, he adds that \"historical data tends to be a weak basis for establishing any priceable insights\". Yet Mr Ismail points out that war risk insurance can be very profitable, something he contrasts with the car insurance sector. \"As a car insurer, for every £1 of premiums you take in, you pay back almost £1.05 in claims,\" he says. You might think that the maths doesn't add up there, but Dr Ismail says that the car insurers make the 5p and more from investment income. By contrast, war risk insurance funds can pay outas little as 2%. Put simply, car crashes remain far more common than war damage. Officials are investigating the firm after the display drew backlash for its potential environmental impact. Tensions have risen across Europe after 19 drones entered Polish territory earlier this month. Russia denies jets entered Estonian airspace in the same month as its drones violated the airspace of two other Nato members. President Zelensky says Moscow seeks to \"intimidate civilians\", while Russia reports four deaths in a Ukrainian strike.

Staples like milk and bread, life and medical insurance and life-saving drugs will become tax-free. Consumption tax on small cars, television sets and air conditioners will drop from 28% to 18%. And other common goods like hair oil, toilet soap and shampoo will be taxed at a marginal 5% instead of 12% or 18%. The sweeping cuts are part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's major overhaul of India's complex goods and services tax (GST) regime announcedearlier this month. This is expected to both simplify the tax code and give flagging household consumption - which makes up over half of India's gross domestic product (GDP) - a much-needed fillip. The timing couldn't be more opportune. Lower GST rates coincide with the beginning of a long festive season when Indians typically open their purse strings to buy everything from new cars to clothes. This four-month period also brings in a bulk of yearly sales for consumer goods companies such as packaged food makers and apparel manufacturers. The hope is, reduced taxes will mitigate some of the impact of the US's bruising50% tariffson India, leave people with more money to spend and spruce up the domestic economy. The cuts come off the back of a$12bn income tax giveawayannounced in February and lower interest rates from India's central bank, all of which bode well for a consumption pick-up. Companies, including Reliance, consumer staples giant HUL, and automaker Mahindra & Mahindra will pass on lower taxes to consumers to boost demand. Carmakers are banking on the cuts, with share prices up 6-17% since Modi's August announcement, while dealerships report rising enquiries amid unsold inventory. At a Mumbai showroom of Hero Motocorp, India's largest motorbike manufacturer, a dealer told the BBC that he expected sales to jump 30–40% over the next two months compared to last year. \"Easing the cost burden of first-time owners has increased enquiries and footfall,\" Ashutosh Varma, Hero India's chief business officer, told the BBC. This is especially so for \"cheaper variants\", he said, where price sensitivity is the highest. Vishal Pawar, a software developer who was at the showroom, said he's considering upgrading to a 200cc bike this year. \"The best time to buy is when festival discounts and tax cuts overlap. I'll make the purchase during theDussehrafestival,\" Mr Pawar said. Companies that make consumer goods are also upbeat about a pick-up in demand. Sabyasachi Gupta of Godrej Enterprises Group said the tax cuts coupled with a good harvest could go some way in expanding the market for discretionary goods like air-conditioners beyond the metro cities. But the changes have led to a last-minute scramble among companies like his - right from reprinting labels to reflect new prices and balancing production with uncertain demand. \"We're keeping old and new labels side by side so consumers can see their savings,\" Mr Gupta told the BBC. Among smaller brands and shopkeepers, news of the tax changes is slow to reach, and many say they lack the capacity to adjust pricing and packaging on short notice. In Mumbai's iconic Crawford Market, the city's biggest wholesale and retail hub where everything from spices to sequins are sold, few shopkeepers were aware of changes to GST slabs. Those who knew about it were confused. Sheikh Rehman, who owns a crockery store, said he was still negotiating with his suppliers on how to manage taxes on the inventory he had already purchased. Next door, at a bridal showroom there was disappointment. The government has cut GST on garments costing less than $29 (£21.2) to 5%, but items priced above that figure now face a higher levy of 18%. Wedding outfits rarely cost less than $29, meaning nearly every ensemble in Naresh G's store will attract a higher tax. This could have a cascading impact across the supply chain from craftsmen to designers and retailers. \"Indians spend a lot on wedding clothes and the season is just about to start, the tax hikes may take away some of the shine,\" Mr Naresh said. At a net level though, the impact of the GST cuts is expected to be largely positive. According to ratings agency Crisil, lower taxes will benefit a third of an average consumer's monthly expenditure basket and improve the middle class's purchasing power. The extent of the impact will depend on \"the degree to which producers pass the rate cuts to consumers\", Crisil said in a report, adding that the impact will play out over this and the next financial year. The cuts, of course, come at a cost. The government predicts they could lead to a revenue loss of around $5.4bn this year. But independent experts and rating agencies like Moody's expect the figure to be higher, with the strain on the exchequer \"even more pronounced\" in the coming years. These losses add to a bleak macro picture: federal tax revenues have barely grown in the first four months, compared with a 20% jump last year, while spending is already up more than 20%. With Delhi intent on keeping its fiscal deficit - the gap between revenue and expenditure - in check, the Modi government may have to hit the brakes on the big-ticket road and port spending that has driven India's growth over the past five years.

And I'm far from alone - creatine has become the supplement of choice for millions. Originally known for enhancing the performance of bodybuilders and athletes in the 1990s, this white powder is now entering the spice cupboards (well, that's where I store mine) of women in their 40s. It's arguably one of the world's most researched supplements. Thousands of studies have been carried out over the past few decades evaluating its ability to increase muscle mass and overall strength. \"Creatine has become so big, you feel that if you are not using it, you are kind of losing out,\" says Dr Henry Chung, a lecturer in sport and exercise science at the University of Essex. \"It's moved from elite sport into the mainstream. It's not about whether to take it anymore, it's about when to take it - before or after exercise? Everyday? How much? \"In which form is best? Powder, tablets, gummies?\" Creatine is a naturally occurring compound which is stored in our muscles, and helps our cells produce energy. It is a vital component in the ATP-CP system, the fastest, most powerful energy system in our bodies. It fuels the first 10-20 seconds in high intensity workouts - giving that quick, powerful burst of energy. From lifting weights to sprinting round the track, research suggestscreatine supplementation can help improve performance. And away from the gym, there is a growing, but still relatively limited, body of evidence to suggest it can also help with ourshort-term memory, mood and focus. So, can this supplement improve our ability to think, remember and respond? And for me, and many others, will it help clear our brain fog, a catch-all term that describes an inability to think clearly, string a sentence together, and remember the simplest of things? For some people with serious post-viral conditions, brain fog can be longer term and potentially life-changing. If you have concerns, it is best to seek medical help. For most, brain fog is usually temporary and can happen because of an illness or certain types of medical treatment. For millions of women, it can be a symptom of the perimenopause, due to hormonal fluctuations. Katie Mansell believes creatine has helped in many parts of her life. The 46-year-old from Merseyside lifts weights, runs 30-40 miles a week, has a full-on job as the chief financial officer of a software company, and a busy home life with a teenage son and two dogs. \"A few months ago, I was out of sorts. I was finding training really hard work and I was struggling to focus on things,\" she says. \"It was my friend who recommended it - she said it was a game changer.\" Katie, who is also perimenopausal, started taking six grams of creatine a day three months ago, and is beginning to feel a difference. Her mood feels a bit lighter, she can lift heavier weights and the fog that had descended on her brain has started to lift. \"I've got more motivation to do things, especially when it comes to training. I feel stronger when I'm lifting and bouldering, and I can also think more clearly.\" Katie does caveat this - she's also on magnesium supplements and has started on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), but she's confident that creatine is making an impact and will continue with her daily dose. There are others who believe it's made little difference and there is divided opinion on whether the majority of us get the amount of creatine we need through our diets. Katie, who is a vegetarian, says she was probably missing out. While it's understood our bodies produce one gram of it naturally, the rest comes from high-protein food like meat and fish. The supplement's impact on male athletes has been documented since the early 1990s but, as with a lot of scientific research, female biology was missing from the equation. \"I used to have to guess what my female athletes needed,\" explains Dr Susan Kleiner, a high-performance nutritionist from the US state of Washington. \"All the research was based on men.\" It wasn't until a few years ago that women's hormonal fluctuations were taken into account, says Dr Kleiner, an adviser on the board of Creatine Health, a global initiative set up to promote research on the supplement. \"And that was when scientists started to see a real impact in other parts of the body.\" Instead of just concentrating on how creatine interacts with our muscles in a sport setting, scientists have begun to discover how it could potentially affect reproductive health, bone health and brain function - all of which can be affected during perimenopause, she explains. So does that mean that creatine can help my brain fog? \"That's an interesting thought,\" says Professor Emeritus Trevor McMorris. \"It might do.\" Having been in the field for more than 40 years, he has carried out many studies into creatine supplementation. He says perimenopausal brain fog could have a similar impact to sleep deprivation, something he has researched extensively,finding that high doses of creatine could mitigate the effects of too little sleep. When people use the supplement, the brain may - like our muscles - increase its stores of creatine. This helps produce more energy, which could help improve memory and the ability to process information. But Prof McMorris say it won't work for everyone. His most recent research suggestspeople need to be under a level of stress- for example, being sleep deprived or not having enough creatine in their diet - for it to make a difference. So, in short, when it comes to helping me with my brain fog - maybe - there's potential. The experts I have spoken to believe it's an \"an exciting time\" in this line of research, but that more studies are needed. Dietician Lucy Upton warns that we could start to see more side effects to creatine use because of the supplement's surge in popularity. \"While there is extensive research, that has been in a controlled environment,\" she says. \"Now we need to think about the variation of body sizes, doses and any pre-existing conditions.\" Currently, known side effects are the risk of stomach upset, muscle cramps and bloating. People with conditions affecting their kidneys should consult a doctor before taking it. While Dr Chung sees no harm in healthy adults \"trying it out\", he also says results tend to be \"minimal gains\", adding that \"it is not, by any means, a wonder drug\". As for me, I started taking the creatine in my cupboard but stopped after a month (blame it on the brain fog). Perhaps I'll give it another try. Scenes for a new feature film will be shot at the Bondville Model Village, Sewerby, and Flamborough. Teme Leisure runs the centre for the council but wants to end the deal after a grant was removed. Shropshire power slapper, Darren Godfrey, says boxing saved him as a youngster, and he hopes to help others. A survey shows that 90% people say they are not given plans to help manage menopause. The space will provide \"compassionate care during a profoundly difficult time\", says a ward sister. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

the abandoned Hartsville nuclear power plant in a controlled implosion. Construction of the power plant was halted in the 1980s before it ever produced electricity. The site has remained dormant for decades. The 540-foot cooling tower was brought down to make way for future development, according to TVA officials. The TVA told the BBC that the demolition used more than 900 pounds of explosives and took less than 10 seconds. The video shows a figure dressed in black dropping from a roof at the Utah campus and fleeing towards a wooded area. The BBC's Nada Tawfik gets a closer look at the crime scene and the inside of a classroom where students barricaded themselves after the shooting. Democrats and Republicans condemned the killing of Charlie Kirk yesterday. The conservative activist and influential Trump ally was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University. Donald Trump said in a video statement that he was \"filled with grief and anger at the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk\". Witnesses at the Utah campus event describe what it was like in the moments before and after the single shot rang out. Video from the campus in Utah shows how the event turned to chaos after a single shot rang out.
